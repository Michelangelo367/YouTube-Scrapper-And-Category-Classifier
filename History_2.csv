The Mughal Empire (also referred to as Baburid Empire, Baburid Dynasty) was founded by Zahiriddin Muhammad Babur, a Timurid prince and ruler from Turan or Turkistan, i.e. Central Asia (Uzbekistan). Babur was a direct descendant to the Turkic Emperor Timur on his father's side and also had links to Chagatai, the second son of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, on his mother‚Äôs side.Ousted from his ancestral domains in Turkistan by Sheybani Khan, the 14-year old Prince Babur turned to India to satisfy his ambitions. He established himself in Kabul and then pushed steadily southward into India from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass. Babur's forces occupied much of northern India after his victory at Panipat in 1526. The preoccupation with wars and military campaigns, however, did not allow the new emperor to consolidate the gains he had made in India.The instability of the empire became evident under his son, Humayun, who was driven out of India and into Persia by rebels.Humayun's exile in Persia established diplomatic ties between the Safavid and Mughal Courts, and led to increasing West Asian cultural influence in the Mughal court. The restoration of Mughal rule began after Humayun‚Äôs triumphant return from Persia in 1555, but he died from a fatal accident shortly afterwards.Humayun's son, Akbar, succeeded to the throne under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped consolidate the Mughal Empire in India.

Through warfare and diplomacy, Akbar was able to extend the empire in all directions, and controlled almost the entire Indian subcontinent north of the Godavari river. He created a new class of nobility loyal to him from the military aristocracy of India's social groups, implemented a modern government and supported cultural developments. At the same time Akbar intensified trade with European trading companies. The Indian historian Abraham Eraly wrote that foreigners were often impressed by the fabulous wealth of the Mughal court, but the glittering court hid darker realities, namely that about a quarter of the empire's gross national product was owned by 655 families while the bulk of India's 120 million people lived in appalling poverty.After suffering what appears to have been an epileptic seizure in 1578 while hunting tigers, which he regarded as a religious experience, Akbar grew disenchanted with Islam, and came to embrace a syncretistic mixture of Hinduism and Islam.Akbar allowed free expression of religion and attempted to resolve socio-political and cultural differences in his empire by establishing a new religion, Din-i-Ilahi, with strong characteristics of a ruler cult. He left his successors an internally stable state, which was in the midst of its golden age, but before long signs of political weakness would emerge. Akbar's son, Jahangir, ruled the empire at its peak, but he was addicted to opium, neglected the affairs of the state, and came under the influence of rival court cliques. During the reign of Jahangir's son, Shah Jahan, the culture and splendour of the luxurious Mughal court reached its zenith as exemplified by the Taj Mahal.The maintenance of the court, at this time, began to cost more than the revenue

This is India! Just look how beautiful, magical and spiritual this place is. Green trees, deep blue rivers, hot shining sun‚Ä¶ India. Are you ready to travel back in time again? Buckle up because it‚Äôs going to be a long rough ride! 

Once upon a time, or to be more accurate, around 70,000 years ago people in Africa decided that they got tired of living with angry hungry neighbors aka hungry animals. They left the continent and reached India. It was a long hard way. The scientists will later call it the coastal migration. Yep, they have a word for everything. 

They didn‚Äôt stand idly by. They beginning to learn the surroundings and by 6,500 BC began farming. They also raised cattle, goats, and sheep. Water buffalo were used to pull carts. Guys, now that we have food, let‚Äôs created something to store it in. By 5,500 BC they intended and widely used pottery. Well done people.

DM8U9h6QSCI,Top 10 Famous and DEADLY SWORDS (And Their History),"The first sword appeared during the Bronze Age.  It was made of copper and was uncovered at the Harappan sites in present-day Pakistan.  By the Middle Ages iron and steel swords were being mass produced and used in battle.  Soldiers were trained in swordsmanship and prepared for combat.  It was before the era of guns and high powered artillery and face to face fighting was the norm.  During this time in history, all of the royal generals, kings, and emperors owned personal swords.  These weapons were manufactured by the greatest sword makers of the time.  Many historical manuscripts document events surrounding significant swords.  This article will be examining ten world famous swords that still survive today.  Mythological and legendary swords will not be listed.

Human history is truly a swinging pendulum of ups and downs. The centuries have been sprinkled with both terrible, bleak events, and beautiful hopeful moments.

Since the invention of the photograph, those events and moments have been recorded for us, allowing us a window into a time that we never actually got to see for ourselves.

The history of The Wendigo from Pet Sematary is quite involved and stretches all the way back as far as the 1600s. The 1989 film version of Pet Sematary leaves out any direction mention of The Wendigo, leaving in only a few loose references. The 2019 remake looks to play a bigger part, but has not yet been released at the time of making this video.

In this video, I'll be covering entire history of the Wendigo from it's introduction in Pet Sematary to the role it may have played in Stephen King's 1999 novel The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon. 

I'll be analysing this monster and discussing what it represents in terms of the story, and explaining how it fits into the universe of Stephen King works.

This will cover some of the similarities and differences between King's Wendigo and the real life legend created by the Algonquin Tribe. We'll also discuss how the Wendigo in the story cursed the Mic Mac burial ground in Ludlow, Maine and how that curse affected people hundreds of years later.

When someone asks us a question ‚ÄúWhat do we really know about our world?‚Äù we might as well reply everything or nothing. And both these answers are wrong and right at the same time. We in Smart is the New Sexy want to scour through every page of history books and prove that some facts aren‚Äôt facts at all, they are LIES! 

Confused? Of course, we know some things, pieces of general information about the universe, historical events, and personalities. However, when it comes to facts and dates from the past we rely only on one kind of source - history books. Some of us believe that the information we can find in there can‚Äôt be 100% trusted, because, let‚Äôs put this straight, some of the facts are really doubtful.

10 most terrifying tortures in history
Boiling public opinion: 6-year-old baby tortured by her mother and mistress like an enemy
Horror: Tortured and burned because of suspected witch
""Rustic"" - Sitting wooden horse

When convicted of adultery, the woman was stripped of all her clothes and tied to a torture device with a saddle / donkey shape, in the middle there was a rough round wooden stick similar to the penis attached to the wheel shaft to move, some even get nailed around.


The wooden penis will be plugged into the vagina, when the horse runs, it will bump up on the vulva, causing the offender to bleed and suffer, and the victim will scream miserably.

Most people who are tortured in this form cannot escape death, and if they do, they will be disabled for life.

Hand clamps

This penalty was applied in Chinese feudal dynasties, which lasted until the end of Qing dynasty (19th century). This is also the most popular torture instrument for women during this period.

The woman suspected of adultery will have to put her fingers into a specialized tool for torture. This device will squeeze the victim's fingertip.

If it is too painful, the victim will faint, the cold water will be flushed to the province to continue suffering.

In addition, this form also appeared in Middle Eastern European countries with a device called ""hand grip"".

They are designed in all sizes to crush every part of the female body, from the hands, feet to the knees, even the head of the offender.

Pompeii was an ancient Roman city near modern Naples in the Campania region of Italy, in the territory of the comune of Pompei. Pompeii, along with Herculaneum and many villas in the surrounding area, was buried under 4 to 6 m (13 to 20 ft) of volcanic ash and pumice in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. Many of the inhabitants were also buried before they could escape.

QfsfoFqsFk4,American Imperialism: Crash Course US History #28,"In which John Green teaches you about Imperialism. In the late 19th century, the great powers of Europe were running around the world obtaining colonial possessions, especially in Africa and Asia. The United States, which as a young country was especially suceptible to peer pressure, followed along and snapped up some colonies of its own. The US saw that Spain's hold on its empire was weak, and like some kind of expansionist predator, it jumped into the Cuban War for Independence and turned it into the Spanish-Cuban-Phillipino-American War, which usually just gets called the Spanish-American War. John will tell you how America turned this war into colonial possessions like Puerto Rico, The Philippines, and almost even got to keep Cuba. The US was busy in the Pacific as well, wresting control of Hawaii from the Hawaiians. All this and more in a globe-trotting, oppressing episode of Crash Course US History.

HgMmGr8gFsQ,America Before Columbus (Part 1 &amp; 2) - History Documentary ‚úî,"Welcome!! ~ Feel free to Like & Subscribe ~
- In the United States, Native Americans are people descended from the Pre-Columbian indigenous population of the land within the country's modern boundaries. These peoples were composed of numerous distinct tribes, bands, and ethnic groups, and many of these groups survive intact today as partially sovereign nations.

Since the end of the 15th century, the migration of Europeans to the Americas has led to centuries of population, cultural, and agricultural transfer and adjustment between Old and New World societies, a process known as the Columbian exchange. Most Native American groups had historically preserved their histories by oral traditions and artwork, which has resulted in the first written sources on the conflict being authored by Europeans.

New technology scouring the vast depths are discovering the ruins of these lost lands.

In which John Green teaches you about the Cold War as it unfolded in Asia. As John pointed out last week, the Cold War was occasionally hot, and a lot of that heat was generated in Asia. This is starting to sound weird with the hot/cold thing, so let's just say that the United States struggle against communist expansion escalated to full-blown, boots on the ground war in Korea and Vietnam. In both of these cases, the United States sent soldiers to intervene in civil wars that it looked like communists might win. That's a bit of a simplification, but John will explain it all to you.

ebNO_1fnR0g,Top 10 Most Famous Lesbians in History,"Top 10 Most Famous Lesbians and Feminists in History

Lesbian relationship isn‚Äôt something that surprises people anymore. If couples have to hide even in 2017, what must it have been like a few years ago, when the LGBT community didn't understand their sexuality themselves? The LGBT community owes a lot to the men and women who came before them, knew how society felt about them, and yet, chose to love a member of the same sex openly.

10. Josephine Baker
Josephine Baker (1906 ‚Äì 1975) American-born French dancer, singer, and actor, was known by many monikers, such as the ‚ÄúBlack Pearl,‚Äù ‚ÄúBronze Venus,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCreole Goddess.‚Äù She was the first black woman to star in a major film, Zouzou. She married four times, and her adopted son Jean-Claude Baker describes his mother as a bisexual, and recalled his mother as having many ‚Äúlady lovers.‚Äù

9. Frida Kahlo
Frida Kahlo de Rivera (1907 ‚Äì 1954), was a Mexican painter known for her self-portraits. Much has been written about Kahlo, with her works being celerated by feminists for its depiction of the female experience and form. 

8. Amrita Sher-Gill
Amrita Sher-Gil (1913 ‚Äì1941) was an eminent Indian painter, sometimes known as India's Frida Kahlo. Her affairs with men and women were quite well known, with her using some of them as models for her work. In fact, her work Two Women is considered to be a painting of herself with her lover Marie Louise.

7. Billie Jean King
Billie Jean King (born November 22, 1943) is an American former World No. 1 professional tennis player. She was the first prominent female athlete to reveal her sexuality, when details of her affair with her secretary, Marilyn Barnett, was made public.

6. Virginia Woolf
Adeline Virginia Woolf (1882 ‚Äì 1941) was an English writer and one of the foremost modernists of the twentieth century. Woolf had a passionate relationship with Vita Sackville-West. This relationship inspired one of Woolf's most famous novels, Orlando , featuring the life of a poet who changes sex from man to woman over centuries, meeting the key figures of English literary history.

5. Audre Lorde
Audre Lorde (1934 ‚Äì 1992) was a black writer, feminist, womanist, and civil rights activist. She described herself as a ‚Äúblack, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet,‚Äù and was known for her activist work with Afro-German women in the 1980s.

4. Barbara Gittings
Barbara Gittings (1932 ‚Äì 2007) was a prominent American activist for gay equality. Gittings served as the President of the New York chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis, picketed the White House in the 1960s to let the world know how easily homosexuals could be fired simply on the basis of their sexual orientation.

3. Jane Addams
Jane Addams known as the ""mother"" of Social Work (1860 ‚Äì 1935) was a pioneer American settlement activist/reformer, social worker, sociologist, author, and leader in women's suffrage and world peace. She co-founded Hull House in 1889 with her first romantic partner Ellen Gates Starr. Addams was later in a relationship with Mary Rozet Smith, who was financially sound, and supported Addams's work at Hull House. Addams won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931.

2. Queen Christina of Sweden
Christina (1626 ‚Äì 1689) reigned as Queen of Sweden from 1632 to 1654. Queen Christina rejected the role of a woman, which was simply to provide an heir, by announcing that she did not intend to marry. Modern biographers generally consider her to have been a lesbian, with many affairs with women noted during her life. 
Sources have found passionate letters to Ebba Sparre, and she was supposed to have had relationships with Gabrielle de Rochechouart de Mortemart, Rachel, a niece of Diego Teixeira and the singer Angelina Giorgino.

1. Sappho
Sappho (c. 630 ‚Äì c. 570 BC) was an archaic Greek poet from the island of Lesbos. The word ‚Äúlesbian‚Äù is literally derived from the Greek island of Lesbos, where Sappho was born. Sappho's poetry was lyric poetry, and she is best known for her poems about love. Her poems spoke of the infatuations and love, both requited and unrequited, she felt for other women.

The British responded to the Chinese halting their ships by erecting a blockade outside Canton. They fired a warning shot to turn back a private British merchant ship, the Royal Saxon, which attempted a blockade run, and the Chinese sent out their own navy to defend the runner. They were demolished. The British had better ships and better firepower. They made to discuss a treaty, but the Chinese refused to give in to the British demands regarding ownership of Hong Kong. The British moved on to capture Chusan, an island near Shanghai. Then a rumor prompted them to believe that China planned to strike against them, so they acted pre-emptively and kicked off the Battle of Chuenpee. Again they won, but the slaughter was so horrifying that Superintendent Elliot was glad to seek a peace treaty with the emperor's envoy, Qishan. Finally Qishan agreed to give up Hong Kong, to give the British better trade status, in exchange for which Britain returned the land they'd taken. But Elliot's supervisor back in London, Lord Palmerston, felt the treaty didn't go far enough, especially since it didn't re-establsih opium trading rights. And the Emperor found Qishan's capitulation disgraceful, even threatened to have him hanged for it. What had looked like moderate wins for both sides suddenly threatened to fall apart.

NjEGncridoQ,"Columbus, de Gama, and Zheng He! 15th Century Mariners. Crash Course: World History #21","In which John Green teaches you about the beginning of the so-called Age of Discovery. You've probably heard of Christopher Columbus, who ""discovered"" America in 1492, but what about Vasco da Gama? How about Zheng He? Columbus gets a bad rap from many modern historians, but it turns out he was pretty important as far as the history of the world goes. That said, he wasn't the only pioneer plying the seas in the 1400s. In Portugal, Vasco da Gama was busy integrating Europe into the Indian Ocean Trade by sailing around Africa. Chinese admiral Zheng He was also traveling far and wide in the largest wooden ships ever built. Columbus, whether portrayed as hero or villain, is usually credited as the great sailor of the 15th century, but he definitely wasn't the only contender. What better way to settle this question than with a knock-down, drag-out, no holds barred, old-fashioned battle royal? We were going to make it a cage match, but welding is EXPENSIVE.

After Germany's early push, the situation looked dire in Europe. The United States had resources to help out, but initially clung to an isolationist policy. Gradually, measures like Cash and Carry and the Lend-Lease Act expanded their involvement.  --- (Episode details below)

Why doesn't this series use the Nazi swastika symbol? James explains: http://bit.ly/1Pzy1k5
____________

Germany's blitzkrieg had been largely successful. France fell early, and Great Britain appeared on the verge of collapse. Europe needed more resources to sustain their resistance, but the United States was bound by the Neutrality Act which established a policy of isolationism and forbade the US from supporting foreign wars in any way. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt skirted those restrictions. He lobbied Congress to reinstate a provision in the law called Cash and Carry, which would allow other nations to buy US war materiel with cash and transport it themselves into the warzone. He also established an agreement which allowed him to place American military bases on British colonies in exchange for destroyer ships, thus safeguarding the far reaches of the United Kingdom from possible Axis invasions. When it turned out that the English won the Battle of Britain and successfully staved off the attempted Nazi conquest, America decided to support them in a more substantial, long term way. Thus the Lend-Lease Act was signed: the US would loan equipment to their strategic partners (who were not the Allies yet). Though supposedly the equipment had to be returned, it was pretty obvious that war materiel would not come back in the same shape if at all, so this was really the largest donation of war supplies ever. But it wound up benefiting the US in turn, since the increased production galvanized an economy that had been stagnant since the Great Depression. It also kickstarted the involvement of the US Merchant Marine, who were among the earliest US citizens to give their lives in World War II and suffered the highest casualty percentage of any branch of the service. These unarmed ships navigated U-boat infested waters to bring much needed supplies to Europe, North Africa, and Asia. Despite this, their service has gone largely unrecognized and unrewarded as they are still denied many veterans' benefits and were not even formally thanked by Congress until 2012.

""Sketch History - Neues von gestern"" ist die neue Sketchcomedy rund um das Thema Weltgeschichte. In zehn knapp halbst√ºndigen Folgen nimmt die Sketchcomedy den Zuschauer mit auf eine unterhaltsame Reise durch die Geschichte der Menschheit. Die Reise geht von den Urzeitmenschen √ºber die Renaissance, die wilden 70er bis hin zum Mauerfall. Die letzten Minuten im Bunker 1945 werden genauso beleuchtet wie die Hintergr√ºnde des Kennedy-Attentats oder die Umst√§nde, die zur Meuterei auf der Bounty f√ºhrten.

""Sketch History - Neues von gestern"" zeigt in einer wahren Bilder- und Kost√ºmschlacht, wie Geschichte zu dem wurde, was sie niemals war. Zeigt, dass hinter Kennedys ber√ºhmtem G√§nsehaut-Satz ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" eigentlich nur ein Tippfehler steckt. Und dass ganz nebenbei die Welt an den Rand eines Atomkriegs geriet, weil dem amerikanischen Pr√§sidenten pers√∂nliche Ferkeleien wichtiger waren als die Schweinebucht. Die einzelnen, immer bildopulenten Sketche springen, verbunden durch auff√§llige Animationen, wild durch die Epochen und zeigen, auch dank Special Effects, Maske, Kost√ºm, CGI, die wirklich wahre Geschichten hinter der Weltgeschichte.",History

Thanks to his mother's support, John Snow rose from humble beginnings as a coal miner's son and apprenticed to a doctor in Newcastle. As a young man, he treated many patients during the cholera epidemic that struck Newcastle. He noticed that the traditional explanation for cholera's spread - miasma from graveyards and swamps - could not explain its appearance in Newcastle where he treated patients. He took that knowledge with him to London, where he formally studied medicine and achieved the highest honors in his profession in only a year. His formal study of anesthesia earned him such great recognition that on two occasions he was trusted to work on the Queen. But then cholera broke out in London again. Snow wanted to prove miasma didn't cause it and find the real cause, so he interviewed patients and doctors across the city. He theorized that the diarrhea which came from cholera also helped to spread it. He even wrote up a case study where one street whose well water mixed with sewage had a huge infection rate while across the street their neighbors with pure well water barely suffered at all. Confident that he had found the cause, he published his findings, but the medical community was not thoroughly convinced.

____________

European economies were so closely connected that some people expected they have to avoid another world war or destroy their finances, but in fact World War I had taught them how to prepare for just such a scenario. Germany, France, and Great Britain all invested in their military before war broke out. When evaluating these economies to see how war would affect them, we look at four main factors: GDP,  population, territorial extent, and per capita income. Broadly, this helps us determine how resilient, expansive, self-sufficient, and developed a nation is. All of those factors determine how a nation must conduct its war. For example, the vast territorial holdings of the British Empire meant that they had vast resources to draw upon but needed a long time to mobilize them, which helped Germany determine that they needed to strike fast and win big if they hoped to win the war before Britain's full resources came into play. Japan also estimated that they could win a war in the Pacific if they managed to win before the US had been involved for more than 6 months. These calculations drove the early strategies of the Axis powers, but the participation of the US would later prove to be a crucial factor.

When Robert Harley steps in as England's new Chancellor of the Exchequer, he discovers that not only is the government deeply in debt, but no one knows quite how much debt it owes. Because vicious political infighting between the Tory and Whig politic parties made it difficult to pass new tax laws, Harley turned to a private financier named John Blunt to help find enough money for England to keep up with its expenses for the year. Using Harley's government resources, Blunt instigated a series of get-rich schemes that drove artificial demand for unsustainable land and lottery investments with tremendous short term gains. Before the year was done, Blunt had successfully covered the shortfall for the government that year - albeit at the cost of driving England's already outrageous debt even higher.

a mini-series on the missing millennium of  Ancient past, First thing is to get the story on the conflict, (because there is always a conflict in everything) with what year it is really, it seems some Benedictine Monks were monkeying with the chronological timeline.Also, that the reformation and inquisition were hidden behind religious reasons but were really carried out to suppress knowledge & events and get rid of all of the books & writings contrary to their dogmatic belief system of control they were usurping the powers that be and implementing themselves in control of the people.Part 2 will deal with the book of Veles and the scattered ones of Atlantis. Why Monks and not historians were in charge of this I can only guess. So it is possible this year may really be 1017? Hmm, Fair use, full credit to sources shown below.

My advice would be to make a video and let me know and I'll watch it and give the same courtesy to you, nobody drug you in here but, if you wish to leave constructive criticism that's fine just use some couth, thanks.",History

Although it finds Peter the Hermit's group from the People's Crusade in shambles, the summer of 1096 finally sees the ""official"" forces of the First Crusade set out for Jerusalem. This was not one army, however, but five separate armies led by men with very different motivations and sympathies - many of them surprisingly hostile towards the Pope or the Byzantine Empire. Hugh of Vermandois, brother of the King of France, led one army despite his brother having been excommunicated by Pope Urban II.  Godfrey de Bouillon from the German territory had actually helped kick the Pope out of Rome and install the anti-Pope. Bohemond of Taranto brought an army whose experience primarily came from fighting the Romans twelve years prior. Raymond of Toulouse led the largest army and believed himself the main leader of the Crusade, despite the fact that he traveled with the Pope's appointed leader, Bishop Adhemar. Only Robert of Flanders could be said to be on good terms with both the Pope and the Eastern Roman Empire. When the five armies arrived in Constantinople, Emperor Alexius Comnenus approached them all privately with bribes and threats to get them to swear an oath that any land they conquered on Crusade would be returned to him. They all took it (except Bohemond's nephew, Tancred) and so the emperor sent them across the Bosphorus to attack the Turks at last.

hF_afgUGbcI,7 Astonishing Real Mermaid Sightings From History,"Since the beginning of recorded history, legends have been born surrounding the elegant, beautiful, and sometimes treacherous mermaid. Their siren songs, beautiful looks, and ocean dwelling lifestyle has made the mermaid an enigma in the minds of people everywhere. Cultures across the world have their own versions of this magical being, from the ningyo of Japan to Ariel of Disney fame. A question does come to mind at the mention of mermaids: are they real? For centuries, people from all walks of life have claimed to see this myth in the flesh. Are they real sightings? Are they tricks of the light and the eye? Are people feigning mermaid discoveries for the attention and publicity? It seems history has not answered any of those questions, as sightings are still occurring to this day. Is the mermaid a legend, or is her powerful song still pulling people into her mythical realm?

Ot-acn1whrc,The Coming War On China (John Pilger) | History Documentary | Reel Truth History,"The Coming War on China, from award winning journalist John Pilger, reveals what the news doesn‚Äôt ‚Äì that the world‚Äôs greatest military power, the United States, and the world‚Äôs second economic power, China, both nuclear-armed, may well be on the road to war. 

Nuclear war is not only imaginable, but planned. The greatest build-up of NATO military forces since the Second World War is under way on the western borders of Russia. On the other side of the world, the rise of China is viewed in Washington as a threat to American dominance. 

To counter this, President Obama announced a ‚Äòpivot to Asia‚Äô, which meant that almost two-thirds of all US naval forces would be transferred to Asia and the Pacific, their weapons aimed at China. A policy which has been taken up by his successor Donald Trump, who during his election campaign said ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt continue to allow China to rape our country and that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing‚Äù.

Filmed on five possible front-lines across Asia and the Pacific over two years, the story is told in chapters that connect a secret and ‚Äòforgotten‚Äô past to the rapacious actions of great power today and to a resistance, of which little is known in the West.

Mist√©rios sobre mortos-vivos que se levantam de seus caix√µes para nos aterrorizar e beber nosso sangue fazem parte das hist√≥rias que vemos no cinema e que lemos nos romances. Mas um grupo de arque√≥logos e cientistas forenses reconhecidos colocou em evid√™ncia o fato de que esta lenda pode ser verdadeira. Da Inglaterra √† Rom√™nia e at√© uma ilha misteriosa na Gr√©cia, vamos seguir a pista de um mist√©rio que at√© hoje continua despertando terror.",History

Through pictures, we can be in the room with Stalin or on the battlefield with a German soldier during the Battle of Stalingrad. We can observe the thousand yard stare of a shell shocked soldier, we can witness a pile of dead bodies in the aftermath of the Holocaust, we can feel the destruction of Berlin, we can stare the horror of the atomic bombing, we can see the death on the trenches of the World War One or we can feel the stress of an unemployed man standing in line at a soup kitchen during the Great Depression.",History

Disclaimer: This series is intended for students, to give them a broad overview of a complicated subject that has driven world history for centuries. Our story begins and focuses on the Romane Empire.

A centuary after Constantine, the Emperor Theodosius II found himself wrapped up in yet more theological disputes. His chosen patriarch of Constantinople, Archbishop Nestorius, had angered many other church leaders with his teachings that Christ had separate human and divine natures. Cyril of Alexandria wrote to the Pope in Rome for support against Nestorius, and received permission to excommunicate him. Nestorius responded by having the emperor call an ecumenical council, at which he intended to excommunicate Cyril. But Cyril acted first, declaring for the excommunication of Nestorius and forming a majority by pushing the council to begin early before the supporters of Nestorius could gather. When they did, they formed their own council and excommunicated Cyril right back, only to be excommunicated in turn by Cyril's Council of Ephesus. Theodosius II attempted to resolve this by calling a second council, but this time none of the Western delegates had time to arrive and in their absence, monophysite leaders from the East excommunicated Nestorius again and declared monophysitism the official doctrine of the church. Those who didn't get to participate called this the Robbers Council and refused to acknowledge it. Then Theodosius II died, and this fight devolved onto his successor, Marcian. Marcian called together the Council of Chalcedon to rule on the previous councils, where it was finally decided that Christ had two unified natures, human and divine, and everyone who'd supported the Robbers Council should be excommunicated. Instead of bringing Christians together under an orthodox theology, they split the faith as those who wouldn't accept their decisions continued to preach and believe their own doctrines and a multitude of Christian sects became their own separate orders. Ultimately, these new denominations followed regional lines, which meant that different areas of the empire formed distinct cultural identities shaped in part by their faith, and these areas were less connected to Constantinople and became the first to split off as the empire weakened over the centuries.

10. Columbus Discovered America

9. Paul Revere

8. 13 Colonies

7. Washington Cherry Tree

6. The Crossing of the Delaware

5. Van Gogh Cut off Ear
While in school, learning about famous artists, we all know that Van Gogh was simply a mad man who sliced off his ear and mailed it to his lover, right? Who would really inflict that much physical pain on themselves over an ex? After looking through quite a few letters and it seems more than likely that him and a friend of his got into a scuffle involving too much French wine and a sword. Which normally don‚Äôt mix too well. Van Gogh was certainly no snitch and didn‚Äôt want to report the incident that could potentially put his best friend in prison. 

4. Sphinx Nose
How did the Sphinx lose it‚Äôs nose? Did it get a bad Rhinoplasty?  Or was While Napoleon was invading Egypt, he used the nose as a target practice for his cannons. This is another absurd historical legend that many still might believe. The nose was gone centuries before Napoleon was even born. Napoleon was fascinated with Egyptology and sought to preserve egypt‚Äôs antiquities. The limestone used to construct the sphinx eroded fairly quickly after a few thousand years had gone by. But Egypt is a Muslim country where worshipping idols is not permitted and it‚Äôs still a wonder how this monument is still here. Historical accounts from the 1400‚Äôs say that a religious islamist leader, Muhammad Sa‚Äôim al Dahr, destroyed the nose when he saw people worshipping the sphinx as an idol. 

3. Vikings Horned Helmets
Archaeologists have a better chance of finding a unicorn than finding a horned viking helmet. Even the football team the Vikings, have horns on their helmet. This is just a modern day myth and an artist's portrayal of how the vikings actually looks while in battle. Thiss portrayal began in the 1800‚Äôs when scandinavians artists such as Malmstrom and Mary McGregor included this style of helmet, like we see in this illustration of Leif Ericsson discovering Vineland. Horned helmets did exist but these were over a couple thousand of years ago during the bronze age and used for ritualistic religious ceremonies

2. Stonehenge
One of the biggest ancient mysteries in the world is certainly stonehenge and they‚Äôve been standing in that formation for 5000 years. Oh no don‚Äôt tell me this is a lie too. Could this all be some kind of cruel hoax? Historical records of the monument date back to about 1200 AD but it‚Äôs highly doubtful that they‚Äôve been in the same position we see them today.  A curator from Cambridge University quoted,‚ÄùNearly all the stones we see today have been moved in some way and are standing in concrete.‚Äù This image we see here shows stonehenge in 1877 with stones leaning on eachother. Many monuments around the world must be restored at some point. This photo here shows some type of restoration project going on in 1898 with two men on top of a block that looks like it‚Äôs being placed there with a crane.  This photo shows the crane picking up the block and you can clearly tell this is a massive restoration project. Take a look at the photos and let us know what you believe. 

1. First Thanksgiving
Sorry Guys, American eye has to ruin thanksgiving for you too. And there‚Äôs absolutely no truth to this one besides the feast itself and what we celebrate couldn‚Äôt be anything further from the truth! As a kid you might have believed your teacher saying that thanksgiving was a friendly celebration between Indians and Pilgrims who came together and feasted on Turkey legs and corn, sharing farming secrets. Thanksgiving was basically a celebration after a vengeful retaliation on native americans and it was celebrated around the same time each year. We won‚Äôt get into all the details but if you know how history tended to go between European settlers and Native Americans, you can probably take a good guess. Anyways, don‚Äôt let it keep you from enjoying some stuffing and turkey, which the pilgrims never ate",History

OlwsJWkgu7k,Secret History of the Freemasons ~ Full Documentary,"The first president of the United States, George Washington, was a Mason, along with 13 other presidents and numerous Supreme Court Justices. Benjamin Franklin published a book about Freemasonry on his own printing press. Nine signers of the Declaration of Independence were Freemasons, including the man with the biggest signature: Jon Hancock...

Suspected throughout their long history of plotting to overtake the world accused of fomenting revolution and reviled as devil worshippers that stole King Solomon's treasure the Freemasons claim they're merely a civic-minded fraternity bound together by harmless rituals. Our high-energy cocktail of dramatic reenactment expert interviews and on-location footage entertains historians Akram Elias Stephen Bullock and Brent Morris to retell the Freemasons' central myth concerning Hiram Abiff mythical builder of Jerusalem's Temple of Solomon. During construction he was killed by three workers who believed his ""secret"" would impart magical powers--representing the three evils against which Freemasons believe they're still struggling: ignorance fanaticism and tyranny. Today the world's 2.5 million Freemasons meet to reenact the ritual of Hiram's murder as the initiation ceremony for the main rank of Master Mason.AMERICA: Is America the creation of the Freemasons? For hundreds of years suspicions of a plot to take over America have swirled around the Freemasons the world's oldest secret society. Freemasons led the Revolution framed the Declaration of Independence and Constitution designed our nation's capitaland in the early years of the Republic grew to unmatched heights of influence and power. The untold story of the Freemasons in America reveals secret codes patterns in the sky murder and a radically new picture of the nation's Founding Fathers.",History

10 True Stories in Movies That Are Actually FAKE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPQYtzgsZho

Description:
It has been said that those that do not learn about history are doomed to repeat it. A lot of students may find history boring and would rather focus on the here and now, but sometimes history can be surprising. Bizarre facts and events that we may not have learned about from our high school textbooks. Try as we may, not all information can be stored in a single textbook and history is not an exact science. Sometimes the things that are left out are believed to be ‚Äòtoo sensitive‚Äô or ‚Äòvulgar‚Äô for young people to hear about and needed to be censored.

Then there‚Äôs Myra Hindley who was once branded as ‚Äúthe most hated woman in Britain‚Äù due to her twisted crimes involving children.

Description:
It has been said that those that do not learn about history are doomed to repeat it. A lot of students may find history boring and would rather focus on the here and now, but sometimes history can be surprising. Bizarre facts and events that we may not have learned about from our high school textbooks. Try as we may, not all information can be stored in a single textbook and history is not an exact science. Sometimes the things that are left out are believed to be ‚Äòtoo sensitive‚Äô or ‚Äòvulgar‚Äô for young people to hear about and needed to be censored. Other times it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not deemed important enough or for convenience sake for different cultures. But these are some of those intriguing events and people that helped shaped the world as we know it today, whether we learned about them in school or not.
While many of us would prefer to look to the future, history is a part of everyone‚Äôs lives. But sometimes what we were taught in school was only the tip of the historical iceberg. Here are 10 historical facts they never taught you in school.

M4o1dc41r28,The Dark Ages: An Age Of Light - Part One (Ancient History Documentary) | Timeline,"Check out our new website for more incredible history documentaries: HD and ad-free. http://bit.ly/2O6zUsK

The Dark Ages have been misunderstood. History has identified the period following the fall of the Roman Empire with a descent into barbarism ‚Äì a terrible time when civilisation stopped. Waldemar Januszczak disagrees. 

In this landmark 4-part series Waldemar argues that the Dark Ages were a time of great artistic achievement, with new ideas and religions provoking new artistic adventures. He embarks on a fascinating trip across Europe, Africa and Asia, visits the world‚Äôs most famous collections and discovers hidden artistic gems, all to prove that the Dark Ages were actually an ‚ÄòAge of Light'.

#7 - Life On Mars
Since it has been introduced, we as a society have gotten used to the idea that Mars and probably other planets once had life on them. Although this is something we‚Äôve come to accept to be true, did you know that there is a whole new side of Mars‚Äô history that we didn‚Äôt even know about? Although Mars doesn‚Äôt look like it now, NASA members have seen evidence on the planet‚Äôs surface that leads them to believe that there was once a massive ocean covering a large portion of the northern hemisphere. With that much water, they say that the planet could have been both warm and wet which is an even better breeding ground for life than previously thought. 


#6 - Akrotiri On Thera
The preserved excavation site pictured here is Akrotiri on Thera, a rich ancient city that could possibly be the source of the famous Atlantis. Just like what had happened to the poor people of Pompeii, the Aegean city of Akrotiri was also coated in a thick layer of ash preserving it throughout the ages. The eruption occurred in 1620 BC and wasn‚Äôt truly discovered until the 1960s. This almost perfectly preserved city shows an abundance of wealth that include some astounding paintings depicting Bronze Age life. This discovery gave the world a whole new look and understanding of the Mediterranean sea trade as well as Minoan art. 


#5 - Oracle Bone Writing
There has been a recent discovery that could mean the Chinese were among the first to discover the Americas. Scattered around the southern United States was a collection of 82 old stones that don‚Äôt look like they fit in with anything else from the surrounding native cultures. The messages on the rocks are messages written in Chinese oracle bone script. Oracle bone script is one of the oldest forms of Chinese writings known. When deciphering these messages, words describing a journey seems as though it was written by people exploring a new world. If this is true then that means that the Chinese landed in North America over 3,000 years ago. 


#4 - There Are More Mayan Cities
The strange squarish platform pictured here is thought to be a huge Mayan city that was discovered by a 15-year-old named William Gadoury. This Canadian boy has a theory that Mayans chose to place their cities by following the constellations. After establishing this theory, he figured that there must be another undiscovered city in the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico and judging by this picture, it looks like he may be right. The place in question hasn‚Äôt been seen in person yet but there have been curious sighting from space which is prompting an expedition.


#3 - There‚Äôs More To King Tut‚Äôs Tomb
Being lovers of ancient Egyptian history, we love the fact that there could possibly be more to King Tut‚Äôs tomb. When re-examining the chambers of the tomb with laser scans, Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves found what appeared to be not one but two additional, untouched chambers within the tomb. One of the chambers is thought to be hidden behind the wall you see in this picture. 

After being asked what he believed was behind door number one, Reeves said that he believes, and hopes, that it is the final resting place of Queen Nefertiti. Don‚Äôt worry, they aren‚Äôt going to just bring in a wrecking ball and smash in a wall, when they are ready to reveal what‚Äôs in the hidden tombs, they‚Äôll most likely only drill tiny holes so they can insert cameras to look around. 


#2 - The Costa Rican Spheres
If the sphere pictured here looks familiar it's because they have been a hot topic since they‚Äôve been seen all around Costa Rica, sitting out in the sunshine, hanging out underwater, or like the one pictured here, almost buried completely under the dirt. It turns out that these spheres were left adorning certain towns and buildings depending on the person or people‚Äôs importance or title. The process it took to actually create these near perfect stones was such a lengthy and involved one that these stone couldn‚Äôt be given to just anyone, they had to have some sort of major social standing. 


#1 - Metal Books
The two ancient books you see here are actually ancient texts in the form of metal books. The collection found was a total of 70 of these tiny books that measured to be about the size of a credit card. On the pages of these books are symbols, characters, and markings that are believed to possibly unlock some of the most questioned secrets of some of the first days of Christianity. 

The things these books say could end up changing the way we understand the Bible. Although it appears as though some of the markings refer to a Messiah, a Crucifixion, and possibly even a Resurrection, no one has been able to understand the full context of the language written.",History

After effects, Illustrator, Premier Pro, Audacity, Yeti microphone,

In which John Green wraps up revolutions month with what is arguably the most revolutionary of modern revolutions, the Industrial Revolution. While very few leaders were beheaded in the course of this one, it changed the lives of more people more dramatically than any of the political revolutions we've discussed. So, why did the Industrial Revolution happen around 1750 in the United Kingdom? Coal. Easily accessible coal, it turns out. All this, plus you'll finally learn the difference between James Watt and Thomas Newcomen, and will never again be caught telling people that your blender has a 900 Newcomen motor.

Before empires and royalty, before pottery and writing, before metal tools and weapons ‚Äì there was cheese. As early as 8000 BCE, Neolithic farmers began a legacy of cheesemaking almost as old as civilization. Today, the world produces roughly 22 billion kilograms of cheese a year, shipped and consumed around the globe. Paul Kindstedt shares the history of one of our oldest and most beloved foods.

iloQeu-Yg7U,The Biggest Lies Told in History,"From legends about George Washington to historical monuments, here are the Biggest Lies told in History.  

Subscribe to American Eye http://goo.gl/GBphkv

10. Columbus Discovered America

9. Paul Revere

8. 13 Colonies

7. Washington Cherry Tree

6. The Crossing of the Delaware

5. Van Gogh Cut off Ear
While in school, learning about famous artists, we all know that Van Gogh was simply a mad man who sliced off his ear and mailed it to his lover, right? Who would really inflict that much physical pain on themselves over an ex? After looking through quite a few letters and it seems more than likely that him and a friend of his got into a scuffle involving too much French wine and a sword. Which normally don‚Äôt mix too well. Van Gogh was certainly no snitch and didn‚Äôt want to report the incident that could potentially put his best friend in prison. 

4. Sphinx Nose
How did the Sphinx lose it‚Äôs nose? Did it get a bad Rhinoplasty?  Or was While Napoleon was invading Egypt, he used the nose as a target practice for his cannons. This is another absurd historical legend that many still might believe. The nose was gone centuries before Napoleon was even born. Napoleon was fascinated with Egyptology and sought to preserve egypt‚Äôs antiquities. The limestone used to construct the sphinx eroded fairly quickly after a few thousand years had gone by. But Egypt is a Muslim country where worshipping idols is not permitted and it‚Äôs still a wonder how this monument is still here. Historical accounts from the 1400‚Äôs say that a religious islamist leader, Muhammad Sa‚Äôim al Dahr, destroyed the nose when he saw people worshipping the sphinx as an idol. 

3. Vikings Horned Helmets
Archaeologists have a better chance of finding a unicorn than finding a horned viking helmet. Even the football team the Vikings, have horns on their helmet. This is just a modern day myth and an artist's portrayal of how the vikings actually looks while in battle. Thiss portrayal began in the 1800‚Äôs when scandinavians artists such as Malmstrom and Mary McGregor included this style of helmet, like we see in this illustration of Leif Ericsson discovering Vineland. Horned helmets did exist but these were over a couple thousand of years ago during the bronze age and used for ritualistic religious ceremonies

2. Stonehenge
One of the biggest ancient mysteries in the world is certainly stonehenge and they‚Äôve been standing in that formation for 5000 years. Oh no don‚Äôt tell me this is a lie too. Could this all be some kind of cruel hoax? Historical records of the monument date back to about 1200 AD but it‚Äôs highly doubtful that they‚Äôve been in the same position we see them today.  A curator from Cambridge University quoted,‚ÄùNearly all the stones we see today have been moved in some way and are standing in concrete.‚Äù This image we see here shows stonehenge in 1877 with stones leaning on eachother. Many monuments around the world must be restored at some point. This photo here shows some type of restoration project going on in 1898 with two men on top of a block that looks like it‚Äôs being placed there with a crane.  This photo shows the crane picking up the block and you can clearly tell this is a massive restoration project. Take a look at the photos and let us know what you believe. 

1. First Thanksgiving
Sorry Guys, American eye has to ruin thanksgiving for you too. And there‚Äôs absolutely no truth to this one besides the feast itself and what we celebrate couldn‚Äôt be anything further from the truth! As a kid you might have believed your teacher saying that thanksgiving was a friendly celebration between Indians and Pilgrims who came together and feasted on Turkey legs and corn, sharing farming secrets. Thanksgiving was basically a celebration after a vengeful retaliation on native americans and it was celebrated around the same time each year. We won‚Äôt get into all the details but if you know how history tended to go between European settlers and Native Americans, you can probably take a good guess. Anyways, don‚Äôt let it keep you from enjoying some stuffing and turkey, which the pilgrims never ate",History

Ajn9g5Gsv98,Slavery - Crash Course US History #13,"In which John Green teaches you about America's ""peculiar institution,"" slavery. I wouldn't really call it peculiar. I'd lean more toward horrifying and depressing institution, but nobody asked me. John will talk about what life was like for a slave in the 19th century United States, and how slaves resisted oppression, to the degree that was possible. We'll hear about cotton plantations, violent punishment of slaves, day to day slave life, and slave rebellions. Nat Turner, Harriet Tubman, and Whipped Peter all make an appearance. Slavery as an institution is arguably the darkest part of America's history, and we're still dealing with its aftermath 150 years after it ended.

kcl98aBRkD8,The Unfortunate History of the AMC Pacer - Documentary Film,"Behind all the jokes and insults, the AMC Pacer is actually a car with a great deal of history.  It began as radical new design from an underdog company.  In an attempt to combat the big, bland, boxy cars from Detroit's ""Big Three,"" little American Motors Corporation decided to build something a little different.  Their one-eyed car stylist Dick Teague proposed a small, wide car with big windows and smooth aerodynamics.  Americans had never seen anything like it.
 This in-depth documentary tells the true story of the Pacer.  Unbeknownst to many, the car persevered through manufacturing setbacks, government regulations, and many other troubles.  Featuring a ton of old car advertisements and rare footage of AMC's factory, the film helps paint a picture of the Pacer's world.  Director Joe Ligo sits down with AMC stylist Vincent Geraci, author Patrick Foster, and television personalities John Davis and Pat Goss from PBS's MotorWeek.",History

This documentary uses rare footage as well as unseen photographs to help tell the story of three missions: a global search for the lost island of Atlantis, an expedition to find traces of the master race in the Himalayas, and an astonishing Nazi-sponsored quest for the mythical Holy Grail.

1o8oIELbNxE,Luther and the Protestant Reformation: Crash Course World History #218,"In which John Green teaches you about the Protestant Reformation. Prior to the Protestant Reformation, pretty much everyone in Europe was a Roman Catholic. Not to get all great man, but Martin Luther changed all that. Martin Luther didn't like the corruption he saw in the  church, especially the sale of indulgences, so he left the church and started his own. And it caught on! And it really did kind of change the world. The changes increased literacy and education, and some even say the Protestant Reformation was the beginning of Capitalism in Europe.

European learning changed the world in the 15th and 16th century, but was it a cultural revolution, or an evolution? We'd argue that any cultural shift that occurs over a couple of hundred years isn't too overwhelming to the people who live through it. In retrospect though, the cultural bloom in Europe during this time was pretty impressive. In addition to investigating what caused the Renaissance and who benefitted from the changes that occurred, John will tell you just how the Ninja Turtles got mixed up in all this.

https://www.patreon.com/CaspianReport

In the 14th century a Muslim historian named Ibn Khaldun wrote about the pattern of history. Farmers would build irrigation systems supporting villages and towns. Later some warrior would bring these towns under his rule and form a united political entity, like a kingdom or an empire. Then a tribe of nomads would come along and conquer the kingdom, seize all the holdings and settle in their place and further expand the new empire. As time went by the nomads would assimilate and become soft city dwellers. Exactly the kind of people they had conquered and at this point another tribe of nomads would come along and conquer them and take their empire. Conquest, consolidation, expansion, degeneration and conquest, this was the pattern of history.

Agora (Spanish: √Ågora) is a 2009 Spanish English-language historical drama film directed by Alejandro Amen√°bar and written by Amen√°bar and Mateo Gil. The biopic stars Rachel Weisz as Hypatia, a female mathematician, philosopher and astronomer in late 4th-century Roman Egypt, who investigates the flaws of the geocentric Ptolemaic system and the heliocentric model that challenges it. Surrounded by religious turmoil and social unrest, Hypatia struggles to save the knowledge of classical antiquity from destruction. Max Minghella co-stars as Davus, Hypatia's father's slave, and Oscar Isaac as Hypatia's student, and later prefect of Alexandria, Orestes.

The story uses historical fiction to highlight the relationship between religion and science amidst the decline of Greco-Roman polytheism and the Christianization of the Roman Empire. The title of the film takes its name from the agora, a gathering place in ancient Greece, similar to the Roman forum. The film was produced by Fernando Bovaira and shot on the island of Malta from March to June 2008. Justin Pollard, co-author of The Rise and Fall of Alexandria (2007), was the historical adviser for the film.

Agora was screened out of competition at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival in May, and opened in Spain on October 9, 2009 becoming the highest grossing film of the year for that country. Although the film had difficulty finding distribution, it was released country by country throughout late 2009 and early 2010. The film received a 53% overall approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes and seven Goya Awards in Spain, including Best Original Screenplay. It was awarded the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Feature Film Prize at the Hamptons International Film Festival.",History

BmZ8Miogq54,The History of North Sentinel Island - And Why it&#39;s Illegal to Visit,"With the killing of US Missionary John Allen Chau on the 25th November 2018, a small island in the Indian Ocean called North Sentinel Island became a household name - and his Neolithic, violently isolationist, tribal Sentinelese killers the subject of amazement and mystery. Having lived on their island for around 60,000, they are the modern population group we know the least about, every attempt to land on North Sentinel Island ending in an attack mounted by armed tribesmen on the beach. In this video I'll look at the history of the island and look at how modern events unfolding there can be of anthropological use when looking at the past.

alJaltUmrGo,Imperialism: Crash Course World History #35,"In which John Green teaches you about European Imperialism in the 19th century. European powers started to create colonial empires way back in the 16th century, but businesses really took off in the 19th century, especially in Asia and Africa. During the 1800s, European powers carved out spheres of influence in China, India, and pretty much all of Africa. While all of the major (and some minor) powers in Europe participated  in this new imperialism, England was by far the most dominant, once able to claim that the ""sun never set on the British Empire."" Also, they went to war for the right to continue to sell opium to the people of China. Twice. John will teach you how these empires managed to leverage the advances of the Industrial Revolution to build vast, wealth-generating empires. As it turns out, improved medicine, steam engines, and better guns were crucial in the 19th century conquests. Also, the willingness to exploit and abuse the people and resources of so-called ""primitive"" nations was very helpful in the whole enterprise.

Saving Private Ryan is a 1998 American epic war drama film set during the Invasion of Normandy in World War II. Directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Robert Rodat, the film is notable for its graphic portrayal of war, and for the intensity of its opening 27 minutes, which includes a depiction of the Omaha Beach assault of June 6, 1944. It follows United States Army Rangers Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and a squad (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg, and Jeremy Davies) as they search for a paratrooper, Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last-surviving brother of four servicemen.

The film received universal critical acclaim, winning several awards for film, cast, and crew, as well as earning significant returns at the box office. The film grossed US$481.8 million worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of the year. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated the film for 11 Academy Awards; Spielberg's direction won him a second Academy Award for Best Director, with four more awards going to the film. Saving Private Ryan was released on home video in May 1999, earning another $44 million from sales. In 2014, Saving Private Ryan was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry as it was deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.""",History

In which John Green teaches you about capitalism and socialism in a way that is sure to please commenters from both sides of the debate. Learn how capitalism arose from the industrial revolution, and then gave rise to socialism. Learn about how we got from the British East India Company to iPhones and consumer culture in just a couple of hundred years. Stops along the way include the rise of industrial capitalism, mass production, disgruntled workers, Karl Marx, and the Socialist Beard. The socialist reactions to the ills of capitalism are covered as well, and John discusses some of the ideas of Karl Marx, and how they've been implemented or ignored in various socialist states. Plus, there are robots!

PdsJs0UIm7s,"HISTORY OF RELIGION (Part 1): PAGANS, NIMROD, &amp; BABYLON","In order to understand the many lies that have given to us over time, we must be educated on the truth.  A main part of my ministry is to educate so that lies can be truly seen and bondage be broken.  Many people are against Christianity for many reasons, but one of the biggest reasons is they don't understand the history behind it.  So my next series of videos will be educating my viewers on the history of religion. In an effort to keep the time down, it's just a summary so if there is something left out or that you don't understand leave it in the comments and I will try to answer if I can.  I hope this blesses whoever watched.  The Lord says his people suffer for a lack of knowledge and my goal is to try and stop the suffering.

A note on 'Ivan the Terrible' - in Russia, Ivan IV has the epithet '–ì—Ä–æÃÅ–∑–Ω—ã–π' meaning 'Great' or 'Formidable'. So why is he known as Ivan 'the Terrible' in English? Because he was evil or useless or because of anti-Russian bias? No, because 'Terrible' in English also means awesome or formidable - this was well understood when '–ì—Ä–æÃÅ–∑–Ω—ã–π' was first translated into English centuries ago, but now fewer people understand this. (see definitions 3 & 4 here: http://www.dictionary.com/browse/terr...). The name stuck, and Ivan IV has been known as Ivan the Terrible ever since.

B9YtgV7R4qs,History Channel - Civilization Lost - Full History Documentary,"Around the world, archaeologists are uncovering artifacts that suggest the existence of previously unknown ancient civilizations, much like the mythical city of Atlantis. 

There is a growing belief among certain scientists and archaeologists that tens of thousands of years ago, before the rise of today's man, sophisticated human societies populated large cities that possibly featured mechanized transportation, electricity, and advanced weapons systems. Proponents of this theory believe that these civilizations were wiped off the planet and that the evidence now lies buried miles beneath the Earth's surface. This two-hour special will investigate these beliefs and uncover the truth about people who lived before the beginning of recorded time.

In which John Green teaches you about American involvement in World War I, which at the time was called the Great War. They didn't know there was going to be a second one, though they probably should have guessed, 'cause this one didn't wrap up very neatly. So, the United States stayed out of World War I at first, because Americans were in an isolationist mood in the early 20th century. That didn't last though, as the affronts piled up and drew the US into the war. Spoiler alert: the Lusitania was sunk two years before we joined the war, so that wasn't the sole cause for our jumping in. It was part of it though, as was the Zimmerman telegram, unrestricted submarine warfare, and our affinity for the Brits. You'll learn the war's effects on the home front, some of Woodrow Wilson's XIV Points, and just how the war ended up expanding the power of the government in Americans' lives.

John investigates when and where slavery originated, how it changed over the centuries, and how Europeans and colonists in the Americas arrived at the idea that people could own other people based on skin color. 

Slavery has existed as long as humans have had civilization, but the Atlantic Slave Trade was the height, or depth, of dehumanizing, brutal, chattel slavery. American slavery ended less than 150 years ago. In some parts of the world, it is still going on. So how do we reconcile that with modern life? In a desperate attempt at comic relief, Boba Fett makes an appearance.

__________________________
Narrated by David Ackroyd

Charles Ponzi became known in the early 1920s as a swindler in North America for his money-making scheme. He promised clients a 50% profit within 45 days, or 100% profit within 90 days, by buying discounted postal reply coupons in other countries and redeeming them at face value in the United States as a form of arbitrage. 

In reality, Ponzi was paying earlier investors using the investments of later investors. His scheme ran for over a year before it collapsed, costing his ""investors"" $20 million.

While this type of fraudulent investment scheme was not originally invented by Ponzi, it became so identified with him that it now is referred to as a Ponzi scheme.

A-qVvT32GMo,8 WORST CHEATERS IN SPORT HISTORY WORLDWIDE,"8 WORST CHEATERS IN SPORT HISTORY WORLDWIDE
The most important thing in the life of any athlete is, of course, a gold medal or a championship cup. But while some athletes train day and night for the sake of victory, demonstrating incredible willpower and endurance, then others... let's say, choose some easier and not entirely honest ways to score. It's hard and sad for us to admit it, but cheating is quite common in sports. In some cases it is insignificant and almost harmless, in others... well, it's amazing what people are ready to do to win. Today we are gonna show you 8 stories of athletes who behaved dishonestly.",History

5SnR-e0S6Ic,Globalization I - The Upside: Crash Course World History #41,"In which John Green teaches you about globalization, a subject so epic, so, um, global, it requires two videos. In this video, John follows the surprisingly complex path of t-shirt as it criss-crosses the world before coming to rest on your doorstep, and eventually in your dresser. (Unless you're one of those people who never puts their laundry away and lives out of a laundry basket. If that's the case, shame on you.) Anyway, the story of the t-shirt and its manufacture in far-flung places like China, Guatemala, and India is a microcosm of what's going on in the global economy. Globalization is a bit of a mixed bag, and there have definitely been winners and losers along the way. In this episode John will talk about some of the benefits that have come along with it. Next week, he'll get into some of the less-positive side effects of globalization.

Also, you should turn on the captions.

Magic Weed : The Truth About Cannabis Sativa traces the story of the Cannabis plant, which has been known to mankind for thousands of years and how it serves us in so many ways. The sacred herb was always seen by Shamans and the ancients as a gift from the Creator God(s) of life on Earth. Like food nourishes the body, Cannabis provides nourishment for the mind and works it‚Äôs magic with the soul. Also explored in this documentary is the American relationship with hemp, including it‚Äôs ban during the 1920?s and the various uses of the hemp plant. 

Cannabis Sativa is an annual plant in the Cannabaceae family. It is a herb that has been used throughout recorded history by humans as a source of fiber, for its seed oil, as food, as medicine and for spiritual purposes. Different parts of the plant have different uses, and different varieties are cultivated in different ways and harvested at different times, depending on the purpose for which it is grown. Cannabis or Ganja is associated with Shiva, who is popularly believed to like the hemp plant.",History

But as usual with Crash Course, things were about to take a turn for the worse.

Dfl4ZaiucpQ,The Anunnaki Creation Story: The Biggest Secret in Human History - Nibiru is Coming,"445 000 years ago, ‚Äúcreator gods‚Äù ‚Äì as they call it ‚Äì came to Earth. They were called the Anunnaki, which means ‚ÄúThose Who from Heaven to Earth Came‚Äù.  These beings inhabited a distant orbiting planet called Nibiru, which only entered our solar system every 3,600 years.  They describe Nibiru as many times the diameter of Earth, and abundant with iron oxide, making its rivers and lakes appear red. A side note about Nibiru:  according to the Sumerian tablets, Nibiru‚Äôs atmosphere began to deteriorate and became a hostile place for life, and in order to restore it, the Annunaki needed one important element for their atmosphere:  gold.

'World War One - 1914' is the first in a five-part series covering the Great War. This episode covers the rival alliances that dominated Europe in the build-up to war, the Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente, and the fatal gunshots by Gavrilo Princip at Sarajevo that resulted in the death of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. 

Imperial rivalries, the system of alliances and deep-seated animosities helped propel Europe into a general war. However Woodrow Wilson, the US President, ensured America stood apart from Europe's conflict. In August 1914, Germany invaded France and Belgium as part of the Schlieffen Plan. The tiny British Expeditionary Force could only hold up the German army for a few hours at the Battle of Mons, but later joined the French in saving Paris at the Battle of the Marne. The 'Race to the Sea' followed, leading to the First Battle of Ypres, as both sides tried to outflank each other to the north. Their failure led to a stalemate, in which the devastating power of machineguns and artillery forced infantry of both sides to take cover in deep trenches. 

At sea, Britain's Royal Navy won the war's first naval battle at Heligoland Bight, and imposed a naval blockade on Germany, preventing war supplies (including, controversially, food) from reaching the country by sea. HMS Pathfinder was soon sunk by a German U-boat, revealing the potential of Germany's submarines to overturn Britain's long-held naval dominance.

On the Eastern Front, a Russian invasion of East Prussia ended in disaster at the Battle of Tannenberg, masterminded by German generals Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff. A second victory at the Battle of Masurian Lakes sent the Russian army into retreat. Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia began badly, with defeat at the Battle of Cer. Things went even worse on the Russian front, as Austria's offensive against the Russians leads to heavy losses, and forced Germany to come to the rescue, by launching the Battle of ≈Å√≥d≈∫.

In Africa, British, French and German colonial forces clashed in British East Africa (Kenya), Togoland (Togo), German South-West Africa (Namibia), and German Kamerun (Cameroon). German Colonel Paul von Lettow-Vorbek had notable success repelling the British at the Battle of Tanga. 

In the Pacific, Japan honoured its alliance with Britain and seized the German naval base at Tsingtao in China. Task forces from Australia and New Zealand secured the German colonies of Samoa and New Guinea. German Admiral von Spee's East Asia Squadron won victory at the Battle of Coronel, off Chile, before sailing into catastrophe at the Battle of the Falkland Islands. In the Middle East, British troops occupied Basra, securing access to Persian oil for their fleet.

Winter 1914 saw the French launch their first major offensive to break the trench stalemate of the Western Front. But the First Battle of Champagne led to heavy losses for no real gains. Ottoman operations in the Caucasus Mountains also ended in disaster at the Battle of Sarikamish. The war's first Christmas was marked by games of football in No Man's Land on the Western Front, but early hopes of a short war had now been entirely quashed.

CORRECTION: 7.55 - the map shows Cyprus as part of the Ottoman Empire. Cyprus was part of the Ottoman Empire from 1570 to 1914, but when the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers in November 1914, Cyprus was annexed by Britain.

Countless of lives were lost under their rule and history will never forgive them. Check out these 25 most evil leaders in history. 

It‚Äôs hard to believe that a leader of a country or a church would actively seek to kill lots of people. Not just kill them, but torture them and humiliate them. The darkness these vile leaders displayed can‚Äôt be described.

How evil must you be to use your position of power to oppress innocent people? Take Pope Alexander VI. This awful ‚Äúreligious‚Äù leader would use all sorts of schemes to rob people of their money rich and poor alike.  But that‚Äôs nothing compared to someone like Idi Amin who massacred around 300,000 civilians. Then there are those terrorist leaders like Osama Bin Laden who ordered the execution of 9/11 and ordered his own men to sacrifice themselves in order to kill innocent lives. Check out the 25 most evil leaders in history.

""Never give a ‚ÄúSpeech‚Äù, says Richard Greene. In this masterful talk, he explains how the great speakers in history use 7 secrets and how we can all become a great speaker by following these secrets and by not just giving a ""speech"" but rather creating ""conversations"" from the heart.

Richard has dedicated himself to creating new paradigms in Public Speaking, Politics, and even our understanding of God

Called ""The Master of Charisma"" by The Sunday Times, Richard quit his law practice to coach Presidents, Prime Ministers, Senators, Governors, CEOs, Royalty and celebrities in 44 countries. Chief Judge on TLC's ""The Messengers"", Author, ""Words That Shook The World: 100 Years of Unforgettable Speeches and Events"".

Richard Studied Political Science in The US and UK, ran for Congress in 1992, advises countless political leaders, hosted ""Hollywood CLOUT"", a live ""Hollywood Meets Politics"" talk show on Air America Radio for 3 years, blogs for The Huffington Post, created the non-partisan, celebrity driven ""Choose YOUR America"" campaign and ""The 2014 Midterm Election 'Answer-Thon'"" to increase political engagement in America.

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",History

You'll also learn who mobilized first and who exactly started the war. Sort of. Actually there's no good answer to who started the war, but we give it a shot anyway.

Time makes sense in small pieces. But when you look at huge stretches of time, it's almost impossible to wrap your head around things. So we teamed up with the awesome blog ""Wait but Why"" and made this video to help you putting things in perspective with some infographics! 

This video has been a collaboration of KURZGESAGT & WAITBUTWHY!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra7dDWgGaqI




Take a moment and think about it. Remember it, Share it and maybe, just maybe, we can be great again!

The point of this video? Not to create animosity nor give an audience to hateful statements from people who, because of their own apathy, in part created the world we now live. The point of this video is to make anyone who cares to pull together and stop the down fall as best as they can. To be good to one another and stop blaming everybody else for our own short comings. To heal ourselves so that we can heal others. Not as separate parts, but as a whole sum of Humanity!

This video has now been seen in 190+ countries!
Still people don't seem to be getting the point.
I am a human being just as you. Doing things for the right reasons just as you.
If you're not treating your fellow man (Mankind) (Human Beings) with compassion, or at least treating them as you would be treated, then how are you helping the situation.
And if you're not helping the situation, then what are you doing?
Its not about invisible lines that divide us rather human qualities that unit us.

It's a lie to think your not good enough. There are two entities in the world.
1. Evil This is where one feels Anger, Jealousy, Greed, Resentment, Lies, and Inferiority.
2. Goodness This is where one feels Joy, Peace, Love, Hope, Humility, Kindness, Empathy and Truth.
As I read over the comments I see both Evil and Goodness shared. It is not a country that is evil or good. Rather it is a personal choice of the people in any country to be either Good or Evil. And they do so through their actions.",History

In which John Green teaches you about World War II, aka The Great Patriotic War, aka The Big One. So how did this war happen? And what does it mean? We've all learned the facts about World War II many times over, thanks to repeated classroom coverage, the History channel, and your grandfather (or maybe great-grandfather) showing you that Nazi bayonet he used to keep in his sock drawer and telling you a bunch of age-inappropriate stories about his harrowing war experiences.  So, why did the Axis powers think forceful expansion was a good idea? (they were hungry). So why did this thing shake out in favor of the Allies? HInt: it has to do with the fact that it was a world war.  Germany and Japan made some pretty serious strategic errors, such as invading Russia and attacking the United States, and those errors meant that pretty much the whole world was against them. So, find out how this worldwide alliance came together to stop the Axis expansion. All this, plus Canada finally gets the respectful treatment it deserves. Oh, and a warning: there are a few graphic images in this episode. Sensitive viewers may want to use caution, especially around the 9:15 mark.

8EDlksmj26A,Computational History Group,"Helsinki Computational History Group (COMHIS, http://www.helsinki.fi/computational-history) is a multidisciplinary team that studies intellectual history. The work in the group is guided by methods from various different backgrounds ranging from modern data science and machine learning to history and linguistics.

The main research objective of the group is an integrated study of public discourse and knowledge production that combines metadata from library catalogues as well as full-text libraries of books, newspapers and periodicals in early modern Europe. The group implements this strategy through different projects and is currently involved, for example, in a Finnish consortium to study the development of public discourse in Finland and in an international H2020 project entitled the NewsEye. Of the various historical periods that these projects focus on, the eighteenth-century and the Enlightenment play a central role in the group‚Äôs work.

Why work on metadata?

The core methodology of COMHIS research is shaped by open data analytical ecosystems. These provide transparent and reproducible approach for historical data analysis, as well as generic algorithmic tools that can be applied also more widely in related studies.
 
In our work on metadata, we have harmonized and studied, for example, Fennica, Kungliga, Heritage of the Printed Book (by CERL) and ESTC catalogues. Within past couple year we have put particular efforts on the ESTC and are fast approaching a serious analysis phase on the publishers, edition field and authors in early modern Britain and North-America. One important objective is also to combine the ESTC metadata to full-texts of ECCO that we are also studying. It is our assumption that this will also change the way that one uses big historical data sets, such as ECCO, in text mining. This is something that regards everyone in digital humanities, so stay tuned!

Did you know?

In 2016, Helsinki Computational History Group was awarded an Open Science and Research Award by Finnish Ministry of Education.

Collaboration

Besides the mentioned funded projects, Helsinki Computational History Group collaborates actively with different partners from various countries and backgrounds. We are also constantly looking for new collaborators and partners, so please get in touch!",History
lTTvKwCylFY,The French Revolution: Crash Course World History #29,"In which John Green examines the French Revolution, and gets into how and why it differed from the American Revolution. Was it the serial authoritarian regimes? The guillotine? The Reign of Terror? All of this and more contributed to the French Revolution not being quite as revolutionary as it could have been. France endured multiple constitutions, the heads of heads of state literally rolled, and then they ended up with a megalomaniacal little emperor by the name of Napoleon. But how did all of this change the world, and how did it lead to other, more successful revolutions around the world? Watch this video and find out. Spoiler alert: Marie Antoinette never said, ""Let them eat cake."" Sorry.

Andy Thomas is one of the UK's leading researchers into unexplained mysteries and cover-ups and is the author of many books, including the acclaimed The Truth Agenda and his newest title Conspiracies: The Facts - The Theories - The Evidence, which has just been published in the UK, USA and Canada. 

 Andy is founder of Changing Times, which holds events on mysteries and truth issues, and also runs Vital Signs Publishing, which produced Geoff Stray's influential book Beyond 2012, edited by Andy. Andy extensively writes and lectures in Britain and around the world, and has made many radio and TV appearances on both mainstream and alternative shows. Find out more about Andy at: www.truthagenda.org

Lecture: ""A Conspiracy History of the World"". Why do people continue to believe in conspiracy theories, and what is the real evidence to support them? Andy Thomas explores the alternative history of humankind, as seen through the eyes of those who continually question the establishment version of events -- often with good reason. 

Conspiracies and secret societies with occult agendas may have been influencing our civilisation for centuries, their influence felt from as far back as the Roman Empire, the Gunpowder Plot and the World Wars, to JFK, the Moon landings, Princess Diana, 9/11 and the 'New World Order'. Andy ties it all together in a fascinating and comprehensive overview.",History

Free is nice, but if you can afford to pay a little every month, it really helps us to continue producing this content.

In which John Green teaches you about the early days of the Civil Rights movement. By way of providing context for this, John also talks a bit about wider America in the 1950s. The 1950s are a deeply nostalgic period for many Americans, but there is more than a little idealizing going on here. The 1950s were a time of economic expansion, new technologies, and a growing middle class. America was becoming a suburban nation thanks to cookie-cutter housing developments like the Levittowns.  While the white working class saw their wages and status improve, the proverbial rising tide wasn't lifting all proverbial ships. A lot of people were excluded from the prosperity of the 1950s. Segregation in housing and education made for some serious inequality for African Americans. As a result, the Civil Rights movement was born. John will talk about the early careers of Martin Luther King, Thurgood Marshall, Rosa Parks, and even Earl Warren. He'll teach you about Brown v Board of Education, and the lesser known Mendez vs Westminster, the Montgomery Bus Boycott, and all kinds of other stuff.

Crash Course World History is now available on DVD! Visit http://dft.ba/-CCWHDVD to buy a set for your home or classroom.

Hey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode. The Civil Rights Movement gained national attention with the murder of Emmett Till in 1955: https://www.commonlit.org/texts/emmett-till
That same year, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus, beginning the Montgomery bus boycott: https://www.commonlit.org/texts/rosa-parks-and-the-montgomery-bus-boycott
A young preacher named Martin Luther King Jr. gained national fame rallying support for the Montgomery bus boycott: https://www.commonlit.org/texts/martin-luther-king-jr

In which John Green teaches you about the Progressive Era in the United States. In the late 19th and early 20th century in America, there was a sense that things could be improved upon. A sense that reforms should be enacted. A sense that progress should be made. As a result, we got the Progressive Era, which has very little to do with automobile insurance, but a little to do with automobiles. All this overlapped with the Gilded Age, and is a little confusing, but here we have it. Basically, people were trying to solve some of the social problems that came with the benefits of industrial capitalism. To oversimplify, there was a competition between the corporations' desire to keep wages low and workers' desire to have a decent life. Improving food safety, reducing child labor, and unions were all on the agenda in the Progressive Era. While progress was being made, and people were becoming more free, these gains were not equally distributed. Jim Crow laws were put in place in the south, and immigrant rights were restricted as well. So once again on Crash Course, things aren't so simple.

In which John Green teaches you about the rise of the conservative movement in United States politics. So, the sixties are often remembered for the liberal changes that the decade brought to America, but lest you forget, Richard Nixon was elected to the presidency during the sixties. The conservative movement didn't start with Nixon though. Modern conservatism really entered mainstream consciousness during the 1964 presidential contest between incumbent president and Kennedy torch-bearer Lyndon B Johnson, and Republican senator Barry Goldwater. While Goldwater never had a shot in the election, he used the campaign to talk about all kinds of conservative ideas. At the same time, several varying groups, including libertarian conservatives and moral conservatives, began to work together. Goldwater's trailblazing and coalition building would pay off in 1968 when Richard Nixon was elected to the White House, and politics changed forever when Nixon resigned over the Watergate scandal. You'll also learn about the ERA, , EPA, OSHA, the NTSB, and several other acronyms and initialisms.

5w30XgACSAg,The royal weddings that shaped European history,"To Queen Victoria, marriages were about strategic alliances.

Correction: At 5:38, the map of post-war Germany is missing eastern Prussia. The borders of Austria-Hungary should also include portions of northern Serbia and southern Poland.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

This video was produced in collaboration between Vox and BBCThree.

Over the course of her 63-year reign, Queen Victoria strategically planned marriages to place her descendants in royal families all over Europe. In doing so, she created one of the most remarkable royal families in history. 

By the early 19th century, Europe had been at war for decades. After the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars killed millions, European leaders came together to restore peace by reshaping major states for a new balance of power. Great Britain went on to become one of the strongest states. And years later, Queen Victoria and her husband Albert came up with a plan to maintain that political power ‚Äî they married their children to monarchs across Europe. By the 1880s Queen Victoria‚Äôs children were in several important branches of Europe‚Äôs monarchies. 

The royal unions didn't play out as Queen Victoria planned, but she continued to make more matches anyway. She had 42 grandchildren, and these 7 ended up on royal thrones. Her grandchildren would end up on the thrones of Britain, Russia, Germany, Romania, Norway, and Spain leading up to the most destructive war Europe had ever seen.  

To truly understand the international conflicts and trends shaping our world you need a big-picture view. Video journalist Sam Ellis uses maps to tell these stories and chart their effects on foreign policy.

F7flSW1PGsA,Progressive Presidents: Crash Course US History #29,"In which John Green teaches you about the Progressive Presidents, who are not a super-group of former presidents who create complicated, symphonic, rock soundscapes that transport you into a fantasy fugue state. Although that would be awesome. The presidents most associated with the Progressive Era are Theodore Roosevelt, William Taft, and Woodrow Wilson. During the times these guys held office, trusts were busted, national parks were founded, social programs were enacted, and tariffs were lowered. It wasn't all positive though, as their collective tenure also saw Latin America invaded A LOT, a split in the Republican party that resulted in a Bull Moose, all kinds of other international intervention, and the end of the Progressive Era saw the United States involved in World War. If all this isn't enough to entice, I will point out that two people get shot in this video. Violence sells, they say.

Subbable message courtesy of Tom Hopkins: I paid 50 bucks, and all I got was this.

Lyrics


I got drunk and fell asleep atop the sheets but luckily i left the heater on.
And in my dreams i wrote the best song that i've ever written...can't remember how it goes.
I stayed drunk and fell awake and i was cycling on a plane and far away i heard you say you liked me.
We drifted to a party -- cool. The people went to arty school. They made their paints by mixing acid wash and lemonade

In my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your name

I found an ezra pound and made a bet that if i found a cigarette i'd drop it all and marry you.
Just then a song comes on: ""you can't always get what you want"" -- the rolling stones, oh woe is we, the irony!
The stones became the moss and once all inhibitions lost, the hipsters made a mission to the farm.
We drove by tractor there, the yellow straw replaced our hair, we laced the dairy river with the cream of sweet vermouth.

In my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your name

You said ""we only live once"" so we touched a little tongue, and instantly i wanted to...
I lost my train of thought and jumped aboard the Epping as the doors were slowly closing on the world.
I touched on and off and rubbed my arm up against yours and still the inspector inspected me.
The lady in the roof was living proof that nothing really ever is exactly as it seems.

In my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your name

We caught the river boat downstream and ended up beside a team of angry footballers.
I fed the ducks some krill then we were sucked against our will into the welcome doors of the casino.
We drank green margaritas, danced with sweet senoritas, and we all went home as winners of a kind.
You said ""i guarantee we'll have more fun, drink till the moon becomes the sun, and in the taxi home i'll sing you a triffids song!""

In my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your name",History

6lJ2uZSRfHI,A Short History of Global Emissions from Fossil-Fuel Burning (1750-2010),"NEW: Interactive version online at http://aureliensaussay.github.io/historicalemissions/interactive.html

These maps depict the evolution of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel burning, cement production and gas flaring worldwide from 1750 until 2010. In addition to a valuable insight into emissions history, this also provides a striking visualization of the progressive extension of the industrial revolution over the past 250 years.

Each dot represents the total carbon dioxide emitted in a given year from a 5' by 5' cell (5' = 1/12th of a degree), the redder the lower, the brighter the higher.

Get more information at:
http://aureliensaussay.github.io/historicalemissions/

These maps have been produced by combining CDIAC national carbon dioxide emissions time series with EDGAR/HYDE 3.2 decadal population dataset (interpolated using Akima interpolation) from 1750 to 2010.

This result in global dataset of gridded yearly emissions over the entire period, at a 5' resolution.

The Big History series asks questions guaranteed to change the way you look at the past. 
Did Napoleon's invasion of Russia come undone because of...tin buttons?  Did New York become America's biggest city because of...salt? How does the sinking of the Titanic power your cell phone? What's the connection between ancient Egyptian mummies and a modern ham and cheese sandwich?

By weaving science into the core of the human story, Big History takes familiar subjects and gives them a twist that will have you rethinking everything from the Big Bang to today's headlines. The series creates an interconnected panorama of patterns and themes that links history to dozens of fields including astronomy, biology, chemistry, and geology.  The first season ends with a two-hour finale that pulls everything we know about science and history into one grand narrative of the universe and us.",History

HQPA5oNpfM4,The Columbian Exchange: Crash Course World History #23,"In which John Green teaches you about the changes wrought by contact between the Old World and the New. John does this by exploring the totally awesome history book ""The Columbian Exchange"" by Alfred Cosby, Jr. After Columbus ""discovered"" the Americas, European conquerors, traders, and settlers brought all manner of changes to the formerly isolated continents. Disease and invasive plant and animal species remade the New World, usually in negative ways. While native people, plants, and animals were being displaced in the Americas, the rest of the world was benefitting from American imports, especially foods like maize, tomatoes, potatoes, pineapple, blueberries, sweet potatoes, and manioc. Was the Columbian Exchange a net positive? It's debatable. So debate.

In part one of our two part look at the US Civil War, John looks into the causes of the war, and the motivations of the individuals who went to war. The overarching causes and the individual motivations were not always the same, you see. John also looks into why the North won, and whether that outcome was inevitable. The North's industrial and population advantages are examined, as are the problems of the Confederacy, including its need to build a nation at the same time it was fighting a war. As usual, John doesn't get much into the actual battle by battle breakdown. He does talk a little about the overarching strategy that won the war, and Grant's plan to just overwhelm the South with numbers. Grant took a lot of losses in the latter days of the war, but in the end, it did lead to the surrender of the South. If you want to learn more about the Civil War, we recommend these books:

okcfKaC87r4,"American History Textbooks&#39; Lies: Everything Your Teacher Got Wrong - Myths, Education (1995)","Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong is a 1995 book by sociologist James W. Loewen. More about the book: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743296281/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0743296281&linkCode=as2&tag=tra0c7-20&linkId=fa2a943e54d4746ad736c9585ba27890

It critically examines twelve American history textbooks and concludes that textbook authors propagate factually false, Eurocentric, and mythologized views of history. In addition to critiquing the dominant historical themes presented in textbooks, Loewen presents a number of his own historical themes that he says are ignored by traditional history textbooks. A newly revised and updated hardcover edition was released on April 1, 2008. The New Press lists Lies My Teacher Told Me as its top all-time bestseller.

In Lies My Teacher Told Me, Loewen criticizes modern American history textbooks for containing incorrect information about people and events such as Christopher Columbus, the lies and inaccuracies in the history books regarding the dealings between the Europeans and the Native Americans, and their often deceptive and inaccurate teachings told about America's commerce in slavery. He further criticizes the texts for a tendency to avoid controversy and for their ""bland"" and simplistic style. He proposes that when American history textbooks elevate American historical figures to the status of heroes, they unintentionally give students the impression that these figures are superhumans who live in the irretrievable past. In other words, the history-as-myth method teaches students that America's greatest days have already passed. Loewen asserts that the muting of past clashes and tragedies makes history boring to students, especially groups excluded from the positive histories.

The twelve textbooks Loewen examined for the first edition are:
The American Adventure (1975)
American Adventures (1987)
American History (1982)
The American Pageant (1991)
The American Tradition (1984)
The American Way (1979)
The Challenge of Freedom (1990)
Discovering American History (1974)
Land of Promise (1983)
Life and Liberty (1984)
Triumph of the American Nation (1986)
The United States: A History of the Republic (1991)
In the second edition, Loewen added six more books; including a newer edition of The American Pageant:
The American Journey (2000)
The American Pageant (2006)
The Americans (2007)
America: Pathways to the Present (2005)
A History of the United States (2005)
Holt American Nation (2003)

Lies my Teacher Told Me is the winner of the 1996 American Book Award,[3] the Oliver Cromwell Cox Award for Distinguished Anti-Racist Scholarship, and the Critics Choice Award of the American Educational Studies Association. Sundown Towns was named one of ten Distinguished Books of 2005 by the Gustavus Myers Foundation.
Conservative activist David Horowitz has criticized some of Loewen's assertions for their partiality and inaccuracy, in particular questioning Loewen's claims about the relationship between American Indians and Columbus.

Lies My Teacher Told Me is mentioned in the novel Deadline by Chris Crutcher.
Lies My Teacher Told Me is mentioned in the liner notes of the Rise Against album, The Sufferer & the Witness.

pRK-cI1MpD8,Facial Recognition Offers New Insights into Architectural History,"Look at a map of roads or railroad tracks‚Äîthe winding lines suffuse the terrain like veins in a body.

That‚Äôs no accident, because ‚Äúthey are the stuff of life,‚Äù writes Peter Christensen, an assistant professor of art history.

Trained as an architect as well as a scholar, Christensen is the author of a new book‚ÄîGermany and the Ottoman Railways: Art, Empire, and Infrastructure (Yale, 2017)‚Äîthat considers globalization through the lens of an immense civil works project that spanned cultures and borders in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

While buildings may be the glamourous figures in architecture, ‚Äúinfrastructure is what modernizes us,‚Äù Christensen says. And he argues that it deserves a place in architectural history not just as technology, but also as art.

‚ÄúInfrastructures make empires,‚Äù he declares on the book‚Äôs first page. ‚ÄúThe economic, social, and cultural systems of empires are guided by and given form and purpose through canals, bridges, tunnels, ports, and, perhaps most importantly, railways.‚Äù

And the construction of infrastructure is, at many levels, a collaborative one, crossing boundaries to take advantage of expertise and finances, and reliant not just on the vision of architects and engineers but of local laborers, too. ‚ÄúThere are multiple layers of authorship involved in the creation of buildings and all the other objects that go into engineering a railway network,‚Äù says Christensen, who has also studied a similar effort in western Canada.

Conceived of by the Ottoman sultan, the railways of the Ottoman Empire‚Äîwhich encompassed the lands of what are now Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq, Israel, and Greece‚Äîwere largely a German project in engineering, materials, and finances. But the relationship between the two empires was always an ambiguous one. While the German Empire was a rising power during the Ottoman Empire‚Äôs decline, and the railway project was characterized by the international press as a colonial one, with Germany at the helm, the connection was more dynamic than antagonistic, Christensen argues. 

He finds testament to the cross-cultural nature of the effort in material artifacts of the Ottoman railway, including train stations, maps, bridges, and monuments. German architects created standard designs for the railway stations based on the size of the towns‚Äô populations. But he didn‚Äôt see such replication when he studied the stations that were actually built. Instead, he found that key elements of design‚Äîthe form of the windows, for instance, or the stone carving‚Äîwere the handiwork of workers across the multicultural Ottoman Empire, laboring in different environmental conditions and drawing on their own cultural aesthetics. 

‚ÄúThis is the moment that crystalizes globalization in architecture,‚Äù Christensen says, ‚Äúbecause styles are conflating freely, ideas and models of architecture are traveling and being changed.‚Äù

His book is part of a larger project that also involves three-dimensional imaging. He and his research team have used 3D scanning to map precisely where the various Ottoman railway stations differ, zeroing in on the contributions of on-the-ground laborers, who typically figure little in architectural history. It‚Äôs a technology that he‚Äôs continuing to develop‚Äîwith current collaborations at the Rochester Museum and Science Center and the Museum of Modern Art‚Äîto yield a tool he hopes will be broadly useful to architectural and art historians.  

Christensen‚Äôs book is also the product of a low-tech but time-honored skill for art historians: scouring the archives. Few of the images that fill his book have been published before, but Christensen says the importance of the Ottoman railway continues to reverberate in contemporary life. ‚ÄúAs recently as 100 years ago, the borders of these now geopolitical hotspots were completely different‚Äîand this railway was meant to connect these disparate lands,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAfter World War I, the border between Syria and Turkey was made by the railway line‚Äîit was an arbitrary line in the proverbial sand.

‚ÄúWe live with the after effects of the creation of these networks to this day.‚Äù

1-JAx3nUwms,A Brief History of Pi,"Get 10% off Squarespace by following this link: http://squarespace.com/simonclark

Check out my new website here! https://www.simonoxfphys.com/

Note that there's a huge amount about pi that I didn't cover in this video due to time - I didn't even mention proofs of it being irrational and transcendental, or why we call it pi! I chose to focus on the development of its approximation as a hook to teach the broader history of mathematics, rather than make this video an exhaustive list of facts. The wiki is a great place to learn more about the rest of the number's history and applications in maths and physics: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi#History 

A few nitpicky things:
- I made mistakes distinguishing between 'digits of pi calculated' and 'decimal points of pi calculated' in some sections, so it is possible that this error is elsewhere without me knowing.
- Archimedes didn't do his approximation with squares, he started with hexagons and then increased the order of the polygon. I chose to present the zeroth order version of his algorithm using squares for simplicity, but note that this is not what he did.
- Something which got lost from the final version of this video is my argument that during the Age of Enlightenment pi shifted from being a physical (measured) constant to a purely logical (theoretical) one. This then embodies the philosophical shift in society at the time. This is hinted at but not fully explained, so I thought I'd put this here.
- Lastly, I am truly sorry for the pronunciations which I doubtlessly completely murdered in this video. At least I spared you my attempt at Chinese.

I am hugely indebted to Alex Bellos and his excellent book Alex's Adventures in Numberland for the inspiration to make this video. There is an entire chapter of the book devoted to a broader but shallower discussion of pi and its history, which I highly recommend.

Speaker Biography: For four decades the BeauSoleil Quartet has taken traditional ingredients -- waltzes, two-steps, soulful Cajun French lyrics, hot fiddle licks and irresistible accordion -- and spiced them up with eclectic percussion, acoustic guitar in both finger-picked and flat-picked styles and an open and creative attitude toward the music. BeauSoleil was the first Cajun band to win a Grammy Award (1998) and added a second in 2008. In 2011 the quartet was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame.

ZTC_RxWN_xo,Secret History of Silicon Valley,"[Recorded: November 20, 2008]

Today, Silicon Valley is known around the world as a fount of technology innovation and development fueled by private venture capital and peopled by fabled entrepreneurs. But it wasn't always so. Unbeknownst to even seasoned inhabitants, today's Silicon Valley had its start in government secrecy and wartime urgency.

In this lecture, renowned serial entrepreneur Steve Blank presents how the roots of Silicon Valley sprang not from the later development of the silicon semiconductor but instead from the earlier technology duel over the skies of Germany and secret efforts around (and over) the Soviet Union. World War II, the Cold War and one Stanford professor set the stage for the creation and explosive growth of entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley. The world was forever changed when the Defense Department, CIA and the National Security Agency acted like today's venture capitalists funding this first wave of entrepreneurship. Steve Blank shows how these groundbreaking early advances lead up to the high-octane, venture capital fueled Silicon Valley we know today.

ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON
Hillary Clinton has served as Secretary of State, Senator from New York, First Lady of the United States, First Lady of Arkansas, a practicing lawyer and law professor, activist, and volunteer, but the first things her friends and family will tell you is that she‚Äôs never forgotten where she came from or who she‚Äôs been fighting for throughout her life. Hillary was raised in a suburb of Illinois where she attended public school and was raised a Methodist by her parents. She attended Wellesley College, and went on to study law at Yale. After attending Yale Law School, she went to work for the Children‚Äôs Defense Fund, going door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts. After serving as a lawyer for the Congressional Committee investigating President Nixon, she moved to Arkansas where she taught law and ran legal clinics representing poor people. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, one of the state‚Äôs first child advocacy groups. As First Lady under President Bill Clinton, Hillary tenaciously led the fight to reform our health care system so that all our families have access to the care they need at affordable prices. Hillary led the U.S. delegation to Beijing to attend the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and gave a groundbreaking speech, declaring that ‚Äúhuman rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all‚Äù‚Äîinspiring women worldwide and helping to galvanize a global movement for women‚Äôs rights and opportunities. Hillary was then elected to the U.S. Senate, becoming the first woman senator from New York.  She repeatedly worked across the aisle to get things done, including working alongside Republicans after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. When Congress wouldn't do enough for rural areas and small towns, Hillary didn‚Äôt back down. She launched innovative partnerships with the tech industry and provided support to local colleges and small businesses. When President Obama asked Hillary to serve as his secretary of state, she answered the call to public service once again. She was a forceful champion for human rights, internet freedom, and rights and opportunities for women and girls, LGBT people and young people all around the globe. Now she‚Äôs running for President because everyday Americans need a champion and she wants to be that champion.

Jk3iOqKOD7g,History Summarized: Africa,"THE DANGER OF A SINGLE STORY: https://youtu.be/D9Ihs241zeg

It's been brought to my attention that I made two mistakes: 1) Yes, I disappear at 18:26. Not sure how that happened. 2) At 12:25 I use a map of Africa that with some weird borders. That's my bad. But if you look at a legit map of Africa, you'll see the same straight lines in the places that I marked them.
(Remember: making mistakes is ok, so long as we learn from them)

The Epic of Mwindo sure was cool, huh? This video is here to show you all about the lovely continent that it came from: Africa! And BOY are there a lot of misconceptions about it.

This video was produced with assistance from the Boston University Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program.

The Khajuraho Group of Monuments is a group of Hindu and Jain temples in Madhya Pradesh, India, about 175 kilometres (109 mi) southeast of Jhansi. They are one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India.[The temples are famous for their nagara-style architectural symbolism and their erotic sculptures.

Most Khajuraho temples were built between 950 and 1050 by the Chandela dynasty. Historical records note that the Khajuraho temple site had 85 temples by the 12th century, spread over 20 square kilometers. Of these, only about 25 temples have survived, spread over 6 square kilometers.Of the various surviving temples, the Kandariya Mahadeva Temple is decorated with a profusion of sculptures with intricate details, symbolism and expressiveness of ancient Indian art

The Khajuraho group of temples were built together but were dedicated to two religions, Hinduism and Jainism, suggesting a tradition of acceptance and respect for diverse religious views among Hindus and Jains in the region
