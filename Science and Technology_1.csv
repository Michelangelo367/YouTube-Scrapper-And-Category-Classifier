Title: Convergence in Biomedicine

Summary

Recent professionalization and expansion of the sciences has isolated investigators in different fields such as physics, mathematics, biology and engineering. There is no longer a set of renaissance individuals who have mastered the important frontiers of these diverse fields and can creatively find connections‚Äîthe heart of new transformative breakthroughs. Our societal structures, such as departments of science and engineering, and our governmental agencies, such as National Institute of Health and the Departments of Energy and Defense, each have specific sciences they nurture and different scientific cultures that re-inforce the silo nature of science in the United States. Introduction of the term ‚ÄúConvergence‚Äù over ten years ago highlighted this fragmentation and the benefits for society of more integration of different sciences into biomedical research. Convergence arises when multi-disciplinary teams are supported, collaborations rewarded, and environments made available for training.

         Modern biological sciences originated with the discovery of the structure of DNA by Watson and Crick in 1953. This discovery was a convergent event as Crick as a physicist and Watson a biologist. From this discovery, molecular biology arose leading to the amazing development of genetic engineering in the mid 70s and the sequencing of the human genome around the end of the century. These revolutions in biological sciences gave rise to the biotechnology industry, a re-design of medical education, and advances in healthcare. However, these successes in effect isolated much of biomedical science from other areas of sciences such as computational mathematics, engineering, and physical sciences. In 2010, conversations with faculty and officials at MIT led to a public policy initiative to increase the visibility of the promise of an increased convergence of biomedical sciences with computational, physical, and engineering sciences, for meeting society‚Äôs challenges. This began with a report from the National Academy of Science, ‚ÄúA New Biology for the 21st Century‚Äù in 2010; a MIT White Paper on Convergence in 2011, and an article in Science in 2011 authored with Robert Langer ‚ÄúPromoting Convergence in Biomedical Science‚Äù Science 333:527. MIT‚Äôs leadership encouraged this public policy initiative and embraced convergence, with the most obvious example being the founding of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. Convergence in biomedical science is reality at MIT and becoming a reality across the country, but more slowly than many had hoped. One of its major promises is the integration of large data with other technologies and advances, thereby creating new opportunities for increasing the quality of healthcare at a sustainable cost.

Sharp is an Institute Professor (highest academic rank) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and member of the Department of Biology and the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. He joined the Center for Cancer Research (now the Koch Institute) in 1974 and served as its director for six years, from 1985 to 1991, before taking over as head of the Department of Biology, a position he held for the next eight years. He was founding director of the McGovern Institute, a position he held from 2000 to 2004. His research interests have centered on the molecular biology of gene expression relevant to cancer and the mechanisms of RNA splicing. His landmark work in 1977 provided the first indications of ‚Äúdiscontinuous genes‚Äù in mammalian cells. The discovery fundamentally changed scientists‚Äô understanding of gene structure and earned Dr. Sharp the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Dr. Sharp has authored over 410 papers. He is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the Royal Society, UK.

Speaker
Keith Gendreau - Goddard 

The Neutron Star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER) is an X-ray astrophysics mission of opportunity that will reveal the inner workings of neutron stars, cosmic lighthouses that embody unique gravitational, electromagnetic, and nuclear-physics environments. NICER achieves this objective by deploying a high-heritage instrument as an attached payload on a zenith-side ExPRESS Logistics Carrier (ELC) aboard the International Space Station (ISS). NICER offers order-of-magnitude improvements in time-coherent sensitivity and timing resolution beyond the capabilities of any X-ray observatory flown to date. Through a cost-sharing opportunity between the NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) and NASA Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) NICER will also demonstrate how neutron stars can serve as deep-space navigation beacons to guide humankind out of Earth orbit, to destinations throughout the Solar System and beyond. I will overview the NICER mission, discuss our experience working with the ISS, and describe the process of forging a partnership between SMD and STMD.",Science and Technology

This is the first lecture in a series over the course of spring 2018.

This lecture series, which includes imminent researchers and innovators from a wide variety of fields across MIT, will showcase the numerous forms that innovation takes and the pathways it can take from ideation to implementation. 

Title: Advanced Manufacturing - The New American Innovation Policies

Topic Summary

In 2016 the political system experienced significant disruption in part due to an angry voting block suffering from a long decline in American manufacturing, which became particularly acute in the decade of the 2000s. Manufacturing employment fell by one third in this period, 64,000 factories closed, manufacturing capital investment and output suffered, and the productivity rate dropped. The U.S. had been systematically shifting production abroad, and experts began to realize as the next decade began that the decline in its production capability was starting to affect its innovation capacity ‚Äì which had long been viewed as its core economic strength.

         The talk reviews the origins of the policy response to this dilemma, which came to be called ‚Äúadvanced manufacturing.‚Äù  It will trace the way the foundational concepts were developed in a series of reports from in and out of government.  It will explore how, for the first time, an innovation system response was considered and developed to strengthen the U.S. production system. It will examine the key new policy mechanism created by the Administration and supported by Congress, the manufacturing innovation institutes, a complex public-private collaborative model to develop new production technologies and processes, with supporting workforce education. It will review how the new institutes are working, lessons learned as they have started up and possible enhancements that could expand their policy reach.  The talk draws on the new book by Bonvillian (with Peter Singer), Advanced Manufacturing - The New American Innovation Policies just released in January by MIT Press.

J5MFY3DdMjk,Bill Aulet: Vannevar Bush Lecture Series on Science and Technology Innovation,"This is part of a lecture series during spring 2018

This lecture series, which includes imminent researchers and innovators from a wide variety of fields across MIT, will showcase the numerous forms that innovation takes and the pathways it can take from ideation to implementation. 

Summary
Between 1980 and 2005, the dominant share of the jobs created in the US were created by companies that were less than 5 years old.  Innovation-driven entrepreneurship is not just a driver of jobs and economic prosperity but it is seen as one of the most efficient and effective tools to deal with society‚Äôs intractable problems in areas like healthcare, energy, climate change, education and many other areas.  As we look forward, the challenge of how we produce more and better entrepreneurs is an important one.  MIT has been a leader in entrepreneurship education and the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship is recognized for its leading edge work in this area.  This talk will describe the approaches that have proven successful and unsuccessful and what the future looks like for ‚Äúinclusive entrepreneurship‚Äù that will go beyond the physical boundaries of MIT to educate millions in the future as opposed to thousands today.

About the Speaker
Bill Aulet is the Managing Director of the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship and Professor of the Practice at the MIT Sloan School of Management. He is changing the way entrepreneurship is understood, taught, and practiced around the world. Bill is an award-winning educator and author whose current work is built off the foundation of his 25-year successful business career first at IBM and then as a three-time serial entrepreneur.

Retained Search Services

OPUS International. Inc. has earned a reputation as being one of, if not the most respected search firm in the food science industry. Based on our results and our strong belief in ethical business practices we are highly thought of and trusted across the industry.

As a result of this trust, many clients now enlist our services on a retainer basis as opposed to (or in addition to) our standard contingency search services. Retained search assignments are on a contract basis only. Under the contract, we first endeavor to gain a thorough understanding of the client‚Äôs organization and of their positional requirements before commencing our search.  From this we seek to create as comprehensive job outline as possible and a candidate criteria list from which to begin our search for that perfect square peg to fit the square hole in the client‚Äôs organization.

Retained searches often require us to identify and evaluate potential candidates who are not necessarily currently active in the job market. To identify and approach such requires a skill set we have spent years in developing and our professionalism at all times has contributed greatly to our longevity and success. Where possible, our goal is to provide a minimum of three potential and highly qualified prospects for any given position.  Our efforts greatly reduce the cost of our client‚Äôs management and human resources time investment and it is often easier for an independent third party recruiter, especially one with visibility such as ours, to make the initial discrete approach to a suitable and potential target employee.

Under our retained search policies we deem it necessary and ethical to provide a guarantee of finding the successful client and to offer our Off-Limits Policy.

Some of our recent placements include:

    Vice President, Research and Development
    Vice President, Quality Assurance
    Vice President, Technology
    Vice President, Engineering
    Senior Director, New Technologies
    Senior Director, R&D
    Senior Director, Food Safety

Off-Limits Policy

From the date that a Retained Search Contract is signed by a client, we guarantee that we will not recruit senior executives (or other pre-defined positions or levels) for the duration of the contract or a period of 1 year from the time at which the contract goes into effect, whichever is the longer. We reserve the right to negate this policy in the event of cancellation of the contract before the search is completed, non-payment of fees and/or expenses due, or changes in the client organization‚Äôs ownership that affects the contact and our relationship with the client.  Also, under our Off-Limits Policy, any candidate placed into the client‚Äôs employ as the result of any contract with OPUS International, Inc., will not be targeted for future recruitment by OPUS International, Inc. while he or she remains in the client‚Äôs employ.  Additional terms and conditions to our Off-Limits Policy may be requested by the client. Should such clauses be required, OPUS International, Inc. can be counted on to provide complete secrecy and discretion.

40voeYiLYdY,Suzanne Berger: Vannevar Bush Lecture Series on Science and Technology Innovation,"This is part of a lecture series during spring 2018

This lecture series, which includes imminent researchers and innovators from a wide variety of fields across MIT, will showcase the numerous forms that innovation takes and the pathways it can take from ideation to implementation. 

Summary
My talk will focus on two MIT initiatives on production and innovation: Made in America: Regaining the Productive Edge (1989) and Making in America:  From Innovation to Market (2013). Over the thirty years that separate the two projects, globalization, the rise of new rival economies, and transformative technological changes have created huge new opportunities and painful challenges of adjustment for society.  On each of the two projects researchers fanned out into companies across the United States and to Japan, China, Germany, and France to try to understand from the bottom up how innovation moves into production and into the market; how and where new good jobs are created; how and where new industries come to life.    Even after thirty years of profound technological, political, and social change, some of the problems we identified in the first study still remain basically unresolved‚Äîhow, for example, to educate people for a lifetime of changes in the workplace; how to move innovation from the lab into society more rapidly. At MIT where we have a track record of carrying out research that brings together faculty and students from departments across the Institute to study complex problems that spill over disciplinary boundaries, we have the resources to make headway on these big questions.

About the Speaker
Suzanne Berger is Raphael Dorman-Helen Starbuck Professor of Political Science. Her current research focuses on politics and globalization. She recently co-chaired the MIT Production in the Innovation Economy project, and in September 2013 published Making in America: From Innovation to Market. She created the MIT International Science and Technology Initiative, and participated in the 1989 Made in America project at MIT. She wrote Made By Hong Kong and Global Taiwan (with Richard K. Lester). She is the author of Notre Premi√®re Mondialisation and How We Compete. Her earlier work focused on political development (Peasants Against Politics) and the organization of interests (Dualism and Discontinuity in Industrial Societies and Organizing Interests in Western Europe.)Suzanne Berger served as Head of the MIT Department of Political Science, founding chair of the SSRC Committee on West Europe, and Vice President of the American Political Science Association. She has been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The French government has awarded her the Palmes Academiques, Chevalier de l'Ordre National du Merite and the L√©gion d'Honneur.",Science and Technology

p3m0i64_DIQ,The Politics of Innovation: Why Some Countries Are Better Than Others at Science and Technology,"Perhaps one of the most interesting and least well understood questions in technology and innovation policy is why some countries are good at innovation and others are not. In his book The Politics of Innovation, Georgia Tech professor Mark Zachary Taylor synthesizes more than 50 years of theory and research on national innovation rates, bringing together the current political and economic wisdom and the latest findings about how nations become science and technology leaders. The book draws on statistical analysis and comparative case studies from the United States, Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Turkey, Israel, Russia and a dozen other countries across Western Europe.

Please join ITIF for a fascinating discussion with the author to better understand the politics of innovation and the implications for the United States.",Science and Technology

5iJfy9ipz34,"Space, science and security","With so much of our modern world and its infrastructure reliant on space assets ‚Äì from navigation to telecommunications, earth observation, environmental monitoring and weather forecasting ‚Äì we have become vulnerable to many threats that could have economic and national security consequences. The UK government policy on space security published in 2014 sought to meet these challenges by making the UK more resilient to disruption of space assets whilst enabling UK industry and academia to exploit science and grasp commercial opportunities in support of national space security interests.
 
The UK is not alone in seeking to ensure effective, reliable and efficient access to space based capabilities and promoting its own industrial and academic science & technology base. The UK has many successful companies and university groups contributing to innovation and wealth creation, continually punching above its weight with industrial turnover running at almost ¬£12bn per year.
 
Space is the ultimate ‚Äòglobal commons‚Äô, and its use and exploitation is governed by UN treaty. But in recent years the problem of space pollution, including debris from accidental and deliberate satellite destruction, as well as concerns over hostile counter-space programmes (e.g. navigation jamming, communications interception), has become a cause of concern.
 
The lecture will address these and other issues in space security. It will consider ways in which a safe and secure space environment can be sustained and how we must work with partners and the wider community to promote codes of conduct. It will also explore opportunities for UK industry and academia in space security.
 
Interact via the hashtag #securespace on social media.
 
David Willetts is Executive Chairman of the Resolution Foundation and a Visiting Professor at King's College London. He is Governor of the Ditchley Foundation and a member of the Council of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.

The Institute for Security Science and Technology‚Äôs annual lecture is named in honour of H.V.A. (Vincent) Briscoe, Professor of Inorganic Chemistry at Imperial College London from 1932‚Äì55.
 
Records indicate Briscoe provided the first independent scientific advice to the Security Service in 1915, on the subject of secret German writing, and continued in service throughout the inter-war years and during and after the Second World War.",Science and Technology

Q&A is a television discussion program that focuses mostly on politics but ranges across all of the big issues that set Australians thinking, talking and debating.

It is driven by interaction: Q&A provides a rare opportunity for Australian citizens to directly question and hold to account politicians and key opinion leaders in a national public forum and Q&A is broadcast live so that not only the studio audience but also the wider audience can get involved.

We aim to create a discussion that is constructive, that reflects a diverse range of views and that provides a safe environment where people can respectfully discuss their differences.

It‚Äôs impossible to represent every view on a single panel or in one audience but we‚Äôre committed to giving participants a fair go.

In order to be as inclusive and diverse as possible, the program is presented from a range of locations around the country and all Australians are encouraged to get involved through social media as well as by joining the audience.

AMEvBHYix3M,PM Modi inaugurates 106th Indian Science Congress in Jalandhar,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the Indian Science Congress at Jalandhar on Thursday, an annual congregation that witnesses deliberations by top scientific minds of the country.

The theme for ISC-2019 is 'Future India-Science and Technology' and it will be hosted by the Lovely Professional University (PLU), Jalandhar from January 3-7, a statement said. During the five-day-long ISC, around 100 plus conferences and events of scientific and technological origin will also be held, where scientists, senior officials from DRDO, ISRO, Department of Science and Technology, AIIMS, UGC, AICTE, and many elite universities of the US, UK, India and other countries will participate, the statement added.

Union Cabinet ministers, including Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan and Textile Minister Smriti Irani, will also attend the event.

""The government's aim is to deliver the benefits of science and technology to the last man in the society. Scientists being a pivot should put their heart and soul into finding new solutions to the problems facing the nation and improve the quality of life of common man,"" Vardhan said in his message.


The participating Nobel laureates include biochemist Thomas Sudoph, who was awarded the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on vesicle trafficking, Nobel laureate in Chemistry Avram Hershko and, and Frederick Duncan Michael Haldane who was awarded 2016 Nobel Prize in Physics.

The Children's Science Congress will be inaugurated on Friday. Near 150 science projects finalised by the DST are to be showcased, and children will also have the opportunity to listen, interact with eminent scientists and nobel laureates. On the third day of ISC, two-day Science Communicators' Meet 2019 will be inaugurated, where the main aim will be to brainstorm ways of dissemination of scientific information and inculcation of scientific attitude among masses. The Women's Science Congress, to be inaugurated on January 5 will showcase the contribution of women in science, technology and the society.

Some of the past ISCs have witnessed controversies over the kind of papers that were presented there. In the last ISC at Manipur, Vardhan received flak over his comments that cosmologist Stephen Hawking had said Vedas have superior theory than Albert Einstein's e=mc2.

mMuy58DaqOk,"Krauss, Meyer, Lamoureux: What‚Äôs Behind it all? God, Science and the Universe.","Has a scientific explanation of the universe replaced the need for God as cause of its origins? Could life on our planet exist apart from divine intervention? Is there evidence for a designer? Does it even matter?

Join us live at Convocation Hall at the University of Toronto, or stream to your site via YouTube, as we explore explanations of life and our universe. We are bringing together three top minds from three different perspectives for this 2-hour dialogue. We invite you to be a part of the conversation on March 19, 2016 - ""What Is Behind It All? God, Science and the Universe.""


ABOUT THE SPEAKERS:

PROF. DR. LAWRENCE M. KRAUSS, is an internationally known theoretical physicist with wide research interests, including the interface between elementary particle physics and cosmology, where his studies include the early universe, the nature of dark matter, general relativity and neutrino astrophysics. He has investigated questions ranging from the nature of exploding stars to issues of the origin of all mass in the universe. He was born in New York City and moved shortly thereafter to Toronto, Canada, where he grew up. He received undergraduate degrees in both Mathematics and Physics at Carleton University. He received his Ph.D. in Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1982), then joined the Harvard Society of Fellows (1982-85). 

DR. STEPHEN C. MEYER,  Intelligent Design advocate, received his Ph.D. in the philosophy of science from the University of Cambridge. A former geophysicist and college professor, he now directs Discovery Institute‚Äôs Center for Science and Culture in Seattle. He has authored the New York Times best seller Darwin‚Äôs Doubt: The Explosive Origin of Animal Life and the Case for Intelligent Design (HarperOne, 2013) as well as Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design (HarperOne, 2009), which was named a Book of the Year by the Times (of London) Literary Supplement in 2009. In his first book on intelligent design, Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design (HarperOne, 2009) Meyer examined the mystery of the origin of the first life. With Darwin‚Äôs Doubt, he has expanded the scope of the case for intelligent design to the whole sweep of life‚Äôs history. 

DR. DENIS O. LAMOUREUX, received three earned doctorates: a Ph.D. in Oral Biology-Dental Development and Evolution (University of Alberta), a Doctor of Dental Surgery, DDS, (University of Alberta), and a Ph.D. in Interdisciplinary Theology-Science and Religion (University of St. Michael's College at the University of Toronto). An award winning teacher, Dr. Lamoureux is an Associate Professor of Science and Religion at St. Joseph's College in the University of Alberta. His appointment is the first tenure-track position in Canada dedicated to teaching and research on the relationship between scientific discovery and Christian faith. Lamoureux's academic specialty focuses on the modern origins controversy. Previous to this he was a clinical instructor in the Faculty of Dentistry at the University of Alberta from 1991 to 1996, had a private dental practice, and served as a Canadian Armed Forces Dental Officer (he received United Nations & Canadian Peace Keeping Medals in 1980 and 2003). 

ABOUT THE SERIES:

The Religion and Society Series is a movement to generate conversations on the ultimate questions of life. The purpose of the Series is to play a catalytic role in helping community groups and churches across Canada to engage people in topics that deeply matter to individuals and society.

SwKBVfcT8Uo,Science-Art Collaboration Roundtable #1,"December 1, Friday:
6:30-7:30pm: Conference kick-off reception & opening remarks 
7:30-9pm: Science-Art Collaboration Roundtable #1
(Mark Rosin, Shane Mayak, Tyler Volk, Noah Hutton, Jame McCray, and Monica Aiello)

Collaboration between the arts and sciences has a rich history dating back to the Renaissance, and recently experienced a resurgence in the 1960s with the art-engineering group Experiments in Art & Technology. Even more recently, artists have begun to actively collaborate with scientists in all disciplines to expand their artistic reach. But collaboration is not a one-sided event, and the benefits of art and design to the fields of science and technology are well known, from Gould‚Äôs drawings of Darwin‚Äôs finches to the success story of Steve Jobs‚Äô Apple projects. Despite its rich history, collaboration has never been a simple process, and remains a difficult task, largely due to disciplinary boundaries emphasized in our educational system. There are many unanswered questions about the nature of collaboration, authorship of a collaborative product, funding for collaborative works, and the future of collaborations in our 21st century that warrant discussion. This roundtable topic will address these, and more questions on collaboration across the arts and sciences.
What does it mean to collaborate? What can art-science-tech collaborations result in? How does this work get funded? How can we ensure collaboration is not just a buzzword? Who owns a collaboration? Can art influence science as science influences art, and should it? What does the future of collaboration look like?",Science and Technology

p_eFqKekUFQ,The Kabbalah of Technology: Getting Comfortable With the Invisible,"So much has been said and written about the breathtaking wonders of our technological age. Technology's negative impact has also been covered -- how it has depersonalized us, undermined intimacy and caused some of us to lose our souls. But one thing glaringly missing from the discourse is the ""soul"" of technology: What spiritual values does it represent and what transcendent opportunities does ot offer us? How does modern science and hi tech reflect the mystical? Can we bridge the ""soul"" and ""body"" of technology? Can we benefit from its blessings without compromising our integrity?

Please join Rabbi Jacobson in this timely and relevant talk on the deeper meaning of technology, and its power to create convergence and fusion of matter and spirit. Discover hidden dimensions in technology, which will give you a fresh glimpse into hidden dimensions of your psyche and of the cosmos. Learn what truly makes technology tick and how it can help you uncover the forces that make you tick, and perhaps also give you a peek into what the future holds.

The prize is in recognition of Munshi's outstanding work in number theory, a branch of pure mathematics that studies properties of integers, or numbers that do not have a fractional part. In particular, the Prize cites Munshi's profound contributions to the study of analytic properties of L-functions and automorphic forms. The focus of his work is central to modern number theory, one that links arithmetic geometry, representation theory and complex analysis in many profound ways. Munshi has developed an ingenious method which produced a breakthrough in the field, going significantly beyond what was known before. ICTP administers the Ramanujan Prize jointly with the Department of Science and Technology (DST, Government of India), and the International Mathematical Union (IMU). The Prize Ceremony is scheduled to take place on Friday 9 November starting at 14.00 hrs. The programme will include a talk by Professor Munshi, a lecture by Professor Brian Conrey, and a special screening of the film ""Salam - the first .....

Kegiatan ini diikuti oleh 875 peserta yang merupakan peneliti dari Universitas Udayana dan universitas lainnya di Indonesia. 
 Menurut Prof. Dr. Ir. I Gede Rai Maya Temaja, M.P, Ketua LPPM Universitas Udayana, sebelumnya kegiatan ini dilaksanakan secara nasional bertajuk Seminar Nasional Sains dan Teknologi (Senastek). Setelah sebelumnya Senastek dilaksanakan selama empat tahun berturut-turut, LPPM Universitas Udayana mengusung kegiatan ini berskala internasional bertajuk ICoSTH. Kegiatan ini diharapkan mampu mendiseminasikan hasil-hasil penelitian, tidak hanya di tingkat nasional, namun juga internasional. ‚ÄúDi tahun 2018 ini kita tingkatkan menjadi internasional. Selain mendiseminasikan hasil-hasil penelitian, juga dapat merangsang publikasi internasional dari peneliti dan pengabdi di Universitas Udayana,‚Äù jelasnya. Ia menambahkan semakin banyak jumlah hasil penelitian bertaraf internasional, semakin pula meningkatkan jumlah publikasi internasional sesuai harapan Kemenristekdikti.
 ICoSTH 2018 diisi dengan presentasi keynote speaker oleh peneliti-peneliti dari Kemenristekdikti RI, Universitas Udayana, Institute of Technology Bandung, North Dakota State University USA, The University of Western Australia, The State of University of New Jersey. Selain itu, ICoSTH turut menghadirkan invited speaker dari berbagai negara, seperti Jepang, Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, dan USA. Kegiatan yang berlangsung selama dua hari ini juga memamerkan presentasi poster dari peneliti-peneliti yang ikut berpastisipasi.
 Ketua Panitia, Ir. Ida Ayu Astarini, M.Sc, Ph.D mengatakan topik yang dibahas pada kegiatan ini mencakup social science and humanities, food security and agriculture, health and medicine, electrical engineering, materials and process engineering, civil engineering architecture and built environment, veterinary and animal husbandry, biodiversity and environmental science, sustainable development, new and renewable energy. ‚ÄúKami harap hasil penelitian bisa diseminasikan secara internasional, bisa dikenal lebih luas lagi. Nanti kita akan publikasikan dalam prosiding internasional, jurnal internasional, dan prosiding terindeks scopus,‚Äùharapnya.",Science and Technology
xBnYk-DAU5k,Science-Art Collaboration Roundtable #2,"2:15-3:45pm: Science-Art Collaboration Roundtable #2 ‚Äã
(Daniel Kohn, Edgar Choureiri, Tega Brain, Patricia Olynyk, Karen Ingram, and Alexis Gambis)
3:45-4pm: Artistic Interlude curated by Jame Mcray

Collaboration between the arts and sciences has a rich history dating back to the Renaissance, and recently experienced a resurgence in the 1960s with the art-engineering group Experiments in Art & Technology. Even more recently, artists have begun to actively collaborate with scientists in all disciplines to expand their artistic reach. But collaboration is not a one-sided event, and the benefits of art and design to the fields of science and technology are well known, from Gould‚Äôs drawings of Darwin‚Äôs finches to the success story of Steve Jobs‚Äô Apple projects. Despite its rich history, collaboration has never been a simple process, and remains a difficult task, largely due to disciplinary boundaries emphasized in our educational system. There are many unanswered questions about the nature of collaboration, authorship of a collaborative product, funding for collaborative works, and the future of collaborations in our 21st century that warrant discussion. This roundtable topic will address these, and more questions on collaboration across the arts and sciences.
What does it mean to collaborate? What can art-science-tech collaborations result in? How does this work get funded? How can we ensure collaboration is not just a buzzword? Who owns a collaboration? Can art influence science as science influences art, and should it? What does the future of collaboration look like?",Science and Technology

bHCAtFUIaFU,RI Seminar: Michael Wang : From Compliant Mechanisms to Hyper-Elastic Robots,"RI Seminar: Michael Wang
From Compliant Mechanisms to Hyper-Elastic Robots

Professor, Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore

September 12, 2014

Abstract
Compliant mechanisms provide kinematic solutions for transferring or transforming motion or force in a mechatronic system. Rather than relying on sliding or rolling motion as in traditional mechanics, compliant mechanisms produce their mobility based on the deflection of flexible members. This enables the integration of multiple functions into simple topologies, by embedding sensors and actuators to build fully functional and distributed devices capable of complex tasks. Further, the simple topologies in structural, mechanical, and electronic integration could lend themselves to advanced manufacturing techniques such as 3D printing with materials specialized in electro-mechanical sensing and actuation in addition to structural support, such as electroactive polymers and nanoparticle composites. Compliant mechanisms show promise for developing soft robots in addressing many pressing needs such as next generation medical implants and biomimetic medical devices.

This presentation describes an overview of a class of such compliant mechatronic systems and methods for their design and fabrication. It focuses on a computation method for designing compliant mechanisms with distributed compliance and/or made of multiple materials. It also presents an overview of exploratory solutions to modeling of soft continuum, hyper-elastic simulation for soft robots, distributed control of soft actuators (polymers or fluids), strategies for soft manipulation and locomotion, and rapid prototyping and fabrication of hyper-elastic robots.

4PE-QyHBLW8,RI Seminar: Zexiang Li : From Geometry to Startups -The Rise of a New Robotics Industry in China,"Zexiang Li
Professor, Hong Kong University of Science & Technology

March 07, 2014

Abstract
Many problems in robotics, mechanism design and manufacturing research are geometric in nature: Rigid body motion, modeling, analysis and synthesis of both open-chain and closed-chain manipulators, grasping and manipulation with multifingered robotic hands, tolerance formulation and verification, design and control of five- axes machines, etc.In this talk, I will present an effort, which was initiated by R. Brockett of Harvard about 30 years ago, and continued by the Berkeley group and then my own group at HKUST for the last 20 years to develop a unified theory, using tools from differentiable manifolds and Lie groups, for robotics, mechanism design and manufacturing research. First, using intuitive examples, I will recollect some of the basic concepts of differentiable manifolds and their ""engineering"" classifications. Then, I will show how problems in robotics,mechanism design and manufacturing research can be modeled using various types of manifolds as 
their model spaces. Finally, I will highlight how geometric properties of these spaces are being exploited to provide more efficient solutions for optimization problems defined on these spaces.

I will describe how results from this research program are being used as basis for founding of three companies, one in motion control, one in UAV-based consumer products and the other in assembly automation for 3C products. Burrowing from L. Page's words, I credit this effort to ""Geometry as inspiration."" There are grand opportunities for robotic research in China. However, the biggest challenge lies in the creation of an eco-system that foster growth of many more startups from our research and teaching programs. A new robotics institute is being proposed at HKUST for such a purpose.

Title: On Computational Thinking, Inferential Thinking and Data Science

Date: September 26, 2017
Time: 4:10pm to 5:00pm
Locations: BIDS, 190 Doe Library, UC Berkeley

ABSTRACT
The rapid growth in the size and scope of datasets in science and technology has created a need for novel foundational perspectives on data analysis that blend the inferential and computational sciences. That classical perspectives from these fields are not adequate to address emerging problems in Data Science is apparent from their sharply divergent nature at an elementary level---in computer science, the growth of the number of data points is a source of ""complexity"" that must be tamed via algorithms or hardware, whereas in statistics, the growth of the number of data points is a source of ""simplicity"" in that inferences are generally stronger and asymptotic results can be invoked. On a formal level, the gap is made evident by the lack of a role for computational concepts such as ""runtime"" in core statistical theory and the lack of a role for statistical concepts such as ""risk"" in core computational theory. I present several research vignettes aimed at bridging computation and statistics, including the problem of inference under privacy and communication constraints, and including a surprising cameo role for symplectic geometry.

XQChad04dPU,RI Seminar: Daniel D. Lee : Manifolds and Decision Making in Intelligent Systems,"Daniel D. Lee
Professor, University of Pennsylvania

January 15, 2016

Abstract
Current AI systems for perception and action incorporate a number of techniques: optimal observer models, Bayesian filtering, probabilistic mapping, trajectory planning, dynamic navigation, and feedback control. I will describe and demonstrate some of these methods for autonomous driving and legged and flying robots, and contrast these models with neural representations and computation in biology. I will also highlight some new research on machine learning for these systems, and discuss the role of geometrical structures and noise in synthetic and biological approaches to classification and decision making.

bl2iGoOzB4o,The Science of Addiction,"Addiction is one of the most common forms of mental illness in the world. Tens of millions of Americans and over a quarter of a billion people worldwide have an addiction to drugs or alcohol. Everyone who has watched a loved one suffer from addiction wonders, ‚ÄúWhy are they acting like this? Why can‚Äôt they stop?‚Äù And people with addictions wonder the same things about themselves. Many people think of addiction as a moral failing, or as a conscious choice‚Äîneither belief is supported by scientific evidence.

Over the past 30 years, great strides have been made in the scientific understanding of addiction, and this understanding has led to improved outcomes for those afflicted. As this research continues, we will see further progress in the prevention, treatment, and outcome for addiction.

This program will give an overview of the most up-to-date understanding of addiction as a disease of the brain. Some of the top experts in Chicago and in the nation will discuss how addiction changes the brain, what the experience of addiction is like, and what therapies are in development to treat people with this disease.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is being employed in the private sector to optimize production processes, pricing, and other business functions. But apart from national security and law enforcement, productive uses in the public sector have received less attention, despite recognition that the administrative state's foremost challenges include efficient processing of ever-increasing amounts of data, and adapting to new information over time. Duke Law's Center for Innovation Policy, Duke Law's Center on Law & Technology, Duke Science & Society, and the Rethinking Regulation Program at the Kenan Institute of Ethics held a joint conference to explore promising uses of AI and the challenges they pose in administering diverse governmental functions involving science, technology, health and intellectual property.",Science and Technology

yvMpXPrvphE,WEP 2019 KAUST Live: Chiara Cirelli,"Chiara Cirelli is a Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. She received her medical degree and Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the University of Pisa, Italy. Dr. Cirelli‚Äôs research is aimed at investigating the fundamental mechanisms of sleep regulation by using a combination of molecular and genetic approaches. Together with her long-term collaborator, Dr. Giulio Tononi, she has developed a comprehensive hypothesis about the function of sleep, the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis, according to which sleep serves to renormalize synaptic strength, counterbalancing a net increase of synaptic strength due to plasticity during wakefulness. Without sleep, such progressive increase in synaptic strength would lead to unsustainable costs in terms of energy, space, and cellular supplies, would reduce the informativeness of neuronal signals, and would prevent further learning by bringing stronger synapses closer to their level of saturation. In short, according to this hypothesis sleep is the price to pay for brain plasticity during wakefulness.",Science and Technology

x2LYZul94wQ,Extreme Science: The U.S. Antarctic Program,"Antarctica is the coldest, highest and driest of all seven continents.  It is one and a half times the areal size of the continental United States, with the vast majority of its landmass covered in thick ice sheets. 

In the surrounding Southern Ocean, sea ice covering an area about equal to the continent in size freezes and melts annually.  The Antarctic continent and surrounding ocean are distinct in being governed through an international treaty system comprised of the Antarctic Treaty and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctica Marine Living Resources. The Antarctic Treaty System emphasizes peaceful uses of the region with a particular focus on scientific research.  The National Science Foundation manages the U.S. Antarctic science program on behalf of all of government. The U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) continually evolves with the frontiers of science and takes advantage of opportunities for discovery afforded by the unique life and environments of Antarctica.  This talk will describe current USAP goals and highlights as well as the challenges of providing logistics support to make research possible in this remote and intrinsically inhospitable region.

Speaker: Kelly Kenison Falkner, Ph.D., is the Director of the Office of Polar Programs of the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF).  She also serves as Director of the U.S. Antarctic Program, which NSF manages on behalf of all of U.S. government in accordance with Presidential Memorandum 6626 and the terms of the Antarctic Treaty System.  A member of the Senior Executive Service, Dr. Falkner oversees an annual budget of about $450 million covering scientific research and logistics programs in both the Arctic and Antarctic.

Dr. Falkner joined NSF in 2010 as Deputy Director of the Office of Polar Programs and transitioned to Director in 2012.  During the International Polar Year (2007-08), Dr. Falkner undertook a two-year Intergovernmental Personnel Act assignment at NSF as the founding director for the Antarctic Integrated System Science Program for which she was recognized by the naming of Falkner Glacier located in Mountaineer Range, Victoria Land, Antarctica (2009).

Dr. Falkner currently serves as the Head of the U.S. Delegation to the Arctic Council Ad Hoc Task Force for Enhancing Scientific Cooperation and as a member of the U.S. Delegation to the annual Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.  She is a delegate to the WMO Expert Council for Polar and High Mountain Observations, Research and Services.  She is also the lead U.S. representative on the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs.  Dr. Falkner has testified before U.S. Congressional committees on three occasions.

 Prior to Federal service, she was a Professor in the College of Oceanic & Atmospheric Sciences, Oregon State University, where she taught, conducted research for 16 years. She and her team executed state-of-the-art chemical measurements to investigate a wide array of environmental topics the results of which are presented in over 60 peer reviewed journal articles and book chapters.

Dr. Falkner conducted postdoctoral studies at MIT in 1990 under an NSF Women‚Äôs Initiation Award and at the Centre National D‚ÄôEtudes Spatiales in Toulouse, France in 1990-1992 under a NATO Postdoctoral Fellowship and CNRS Poste Rouge respectively.  She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Chemistry with a minor in Russian studies from Reed College with Phi Beta Kappa distinction in 1983 and a PhD in Chemical Oceanography from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution-MIT Joint Program in Oceanography in 1989.

HsLbV92JFMc,The Quest For Evolution ‚Äì Bruce Barton,"Most people assume that the concept of evolution began with Charles Darwin.  But Darwin merely popularized and provided a supposedly scientific explanation for evolution, an idea that has been around for a long time.  A thread of evolutionary thought may be traced back to the earliest recorded civilization. In this presentation we trace evolutionism back to its early beginnings and show how it influenced Greek philosophy, which in turn affected Western culture from the Renaissance down to the present, and became deeply rooted in our culture today.

 Bruce Barton has degrees in meteorology and theology, with studies in engineering and graduate work in atmospheric sciences. Mr. Barton was an instrumentation engineer in R&D for Weyerhaeuser Company until retirement. He has a broad background as a teacher and speaker to groups of all ages in a wide range of subjects including science and technology, aviation, and Bible topics, particularly apologetics. Bruce has been speaking on the Creation/Evolution controversy for over ten years, especially to homeschool groups. He continues to give seminars and lead field trips for them.",Science and Technology

""Microbial resource management in new buildings: microbial ecology influenced by consumer choices and engineering decisions""

ABSTRACT: Diverse bacterial communities assemble in drinking water plumbing systems, where both the composition and the quantity of these communities have potential long-term impacts on the consumers. Building plumbing is not regularly monitored from a microbial perspective and often treated as a microbiological black box. However, plumbing systems are in fact, controllable environments. The owners and occupants of new buildings (unwittingly) exercise critical choices in determining factors for microbial growth, for instance selecting material composition (e.g., copper pipes vs. plastic pipes), system design (e.g., number of bathrooms) and operation (e.g., warm water temperature settings). These choices affect initial biofilm formation and development, and ultimately the establishment of the building plumbing microbiome. Here, the silver lining lies in the opportunity to manage and control drinking water communities by understanding and exploiting the connections between these factors and microbial ecology. Our group focuses on initial biofilm formation and particularly the importance of pipe-related nutrients (e.g., carbon leaching from synthetic polymeric pipes such as PEX or PVC. This presentation will explore the various factors contributing to biofilm development in real plumbing systems, and whether/how these can be exploited to manage drinking water microbial communities.",Science and Technology

#NAME?,WEP 2019 Keynote: Salim T S Al-Hassani,"Time measurement has, throughout history and across continents, been a central part of the lives of Muslims. The need to determine the times of daily prayers as well as the start/beginning and end of the fasting days has motivated people to investigate and develop time measuring devices. Whilst Muslims developed and improved devices such as sundials and water clepsydras ‚Äî which had been inherited from ancient civilizations such as Egypt, Greece, Persia, China, and India‚Äî, they also invented devices of their own, making them popular throughout the Muslim world, stretching from China to Spain. This keynote lecture looks at the historical development of time-measuring devices, focusing on the history of clocks in the Muslim civilization. 

Popular books of science and engineering, however, have largely neglected those non-European contributions. A study of non-European, and particularly Muslim, contributions to the development of clocks, would hopefully allow us to understand the development of science and technology in greater detail and also to enhance inter-cultural respect. The lecture will demonstrate information about clocks found in manuscripts were transferred into AUTOCAD engineering drawings and Studio-Max to produce 3D animations. Focus will be made on the water clock that Caliph Harun al-Rasheed gifted Charlemagne (the holy Roman Emperor), the clock of Ibn al-Haytham, the Elephant clock of Al-Jazari, the water clock of Al-Muradi and the mechanical clock of Taqi al-Din.

It is hoped that the story of the development of clocks in the Muslim Civilisation will not only fill in a gap in the public literature but also inspire the young audience to build a prosperous, sustainable future that appreciates and celebrates the diversity of humanity.",Science and Technology

What we try to do here that‚Äôs a little bit different is to teach people how to make their technology go to work, how to get it really implemented and in the world and doing something.

xJkevg0UGhQ,Ethics of Active Defence,"Patrick Neal, DSSc, Active Cyber Deterrence Researcher
Robert Slade, CISSP, Researcher, author, bombast

This presentation takes the position of active defence as a moral and ethical obligation of the Information Society which must be embedded in public policy and framed into legislative and regulatory instruments. Starting with a short history of strikeback lobbying, the presentation then presents a moral and ethical framework for promoting active defence as a societal obligation.  Taking this position, it is proposed active defence be linked to the society's collective safety and security.  The presentation is based on four years of exploratory doctoral research examining corporate decision makers' attitudes towards active cyber defence.  The research include industry/government consultation, survey methodology, and utilization of established social contract theory, cyber deterrence, deterrence, and information theory.

Biographies:
Patrick Neal has been involved in the justice and public safety field since 1982. He has been a soldier, prison librarian, security supervisor, investigator, and policy researcher. In 2010 he became the Crime and Intelligence Analysis Program Coordinator in the Forensic Science and Technology department at the British Columbia Institute of Technology. Throughout his career, he has used data and information to; develop better responses to justice and public safety incidents, inform policy development, develop insights into how people search for and use data and information. He completed his Master of Arts (Royal Roads University) degree during which he studied the information seeking behavior of police officers. He is awaiting the award of his Doctor of Social Sciences (Royal Roads University) thesis: Protecting the Information Society: An Exploratory Study of Corporate Decision makers‚Äô attitudes towards Active Cyber Defence.  His special area of interest is cyber deterrence, information weaponization, social contract theory, and intelligence /analysis within the cyber domain.  His other life includes a passion for museums, old books, antiques, and fishing.

8HPdVnxjNxw,June Carbone: Gender and the Tournament: Reinventing Antidiscrimination Law in an Age of Inequality,"Since the 1970‚Äôs, antidiscrimination advocates have approached Title VII as though the impact of the law on minorities and women could be considered in isolation.  This article argues that this is a mistake.  Instead, Gender and the Tournament attempts to reclaim Title VII‚Äôs original approach, which justified efforts to dismantle segregated workplaces as necessary to both eliminate discrimination and promote economic growth.  Using that approach, this Article is the first to consider how widespread corporate tournaments and growing gender disparities in the upper echelons of the economy are intrinsically intertwined, and how they undermine the core promises of antidiscrimination law.  The Article draws on a pending case challenging the ‚Äúrank and yank‚Äù evaluation system at Microsoft, as well as social science literature regarding narcissism and stereotype expectations, to illustrate how consideration of the legitimacy of competitive pay for performance schemes is essential to combating the intrinsically gendered nature of advancement in the new economy.

QE0x1DGqnR0,Friday lunchtime lecture: Why should the arts collide at CERN?,"In 2012, the same year that CERN discovered the Higgs boson, another experiment was underway that crossed more than just scientific frontiers: Arts@CERN.

Since 2011, when the first Collide residency awards were announced at the Ars Electronica Festival in Linz, there had not only been engineered collisions between protons at CERN, but also orchestrated collisions between artists and scientists.

So what does a curator add to a highly scientific and technological environment? Why are they necessary to make creative collisions happen and matter? These and many more questions will be answered in this Friday lunchtime lecture by Ariane Koek, founder of Arts@CERN, who initiated, created and designed this extensive multi-stranded international arts programme.

In 2008/9 Ariane Koek was awarded the Clore Fellowship and, as part of the award, initiated an ongoing attachment to CERN, the world‚Äôs largest particle physics laboratory based outside Geneva in Switzerland. Subsequently she became the first cultural specialist appointed by CERN in 2010 and created, designed and directed for nearly five years at the Arts@CERN international programme.

Koek is a Clore Fellow, independent international cultural strategy and policy consultant, producer, curator and writer. She is an external policy advisor to two directorates at the European Commission on arts, science and technology and also special advisor to Baltan Laboratories, Eindhoven, a multidisciplinary laboratory for artists working with technology.

kRYM3wmAgc0,2017 Ramanujan Prize Ceremony,"Prof. Eduardo Teixeira, University of Central Florida, USA (formerly at Federal University of Cear√°, Brazil)
The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) announced earlier this year that the 2017 Ramanujan Prize for Young Mathematicians from Developing Countries has been awarded to Eduardo Teixeira of the Federal University of Cear√°, Brazil. The prize is in recognition of Teixeira's outstanding work in Analysis and Partial Differential Equations and is awarded jointly by ICTP, the Department of Science and Technology (DST, Government of India), and the International Mathematical Union (IMU). The 2017 prize award ceremony will take place on Thursday 12 October 2017 in the Budinich Lecture Hall, at ICTP at 16.30 hrs.
Abstract: Free boundaries are mathematical manifestations of sharp changes in the parameters that describe a given problem. Typically, different physical laws are to be prescribed in distinct, a priori unknown subregions. This is the case, for instance, of problems involving different states of matter. Free boundaries also arise in physical reactions where interfaces retain some portion of the system‚Äôs energy, viz., latent heat, membranes, dead cores, flux balances, and so forth. The development of the contemporary free boundary theory has promoted major knowledge leverage across pure and applied sciences and in this talk I will provide a panoramic overview of such endeavor. Towards the end, I will describe how geometric insights pertaining to the systematic study of free boundary problems can be imported as to investigate regularity issues in nonlinear diffusive partial differential equations, leading to a plethora of unanticipated results.",Science and Technology

U7kL-Li6U9o,Pseudo-Science and Academic Freedom,"There's a tense debate in academia about what should be taught and researched within the University. Climate change denial, anti-vaccination, astrology, intelligent design, homeopathy, spiritual ways of knowing, telekinesis, UFOs, that intelligence and aptitude vary by race, that HIV is not the cause of AIDS - each of these, and more, have defenders in the Academy. 

Does academic freedom protect teaching, researching, and expressing positions entirely at odds with majority or consensus views in science? Is there a cost or harm to public health or social justice?

IME/USP
Quantitative Logic Reasoning
We present a research program which investigates the intersection of deductive reasoning with explicit quantitative capabilities. These quantitative capabilities encompass probabilistic reasoning, counting and counting quantifiers, and similar systems. The need to have a combined reasoning system that enables a unified way of reasoning with quantities has always been recognized in modern logic, as proposals of probabilistic logic reasoning are present since the work of Boole [1854]. Equally ubiquitous is the need to deal with cardinality restrictions on finite sets. More recently, a well-founded probabilistic theory has been developed for non-classical settings as well, such as probabilistic reasoning over ≈Åukasiewicz infinitely-valued logic. We show that there is a common way to deal with these several deductive quantitative capabilities, involving a framework based on Linear Algebras and Linear Programming, The distinction between classical and non-classical probabilistic and cardinality reasoning comes from the different family of algebras employed. The quantitative logic systems are particularly amenable to the introduction of inconsistency measurements, which quantify the degree of inconsistency of a given quantitative logic theory, following some basic principles of inconsistency measurements. On the practical level, we aim at exploring quantitative logic systems in which the complexity of reasoning is ""only NP-complete"". We provide open-source implementations for solvers operating over those systems and study some notable empirical properties, such as the present of a phase transition. This in this talk we concentrate on concepts and examples, aiming at showing that these ideas do have practical applications and decent implementation.

eBwluaTaenI,Secure Development for Snake People - Leigh/Ari of Slack - Duo Tech Talk,"Startups hear the word ‚Äúprocess"" and freak out - shipping code every day isn't optional. What if you could build a secure development process that accelerated development, instead of slowing it down? At Slack, we have - allowing our small team to distribute security work to developers, and building up their security skills from intern to senior engineer. We'll talk through the tools and processes we built - a flexible framework including a lightweight self-service assessment tool, a checklist generator, and most importantly a chat-based process that meets people where they are already working. Together, these encourage security thinking in the tools developers already spend their time in - allowing us to effortlessly document people's thought processes around risk. By empowering developers to think about security themselves and incorporate secure practices into their own teams and workflows, we've defeated the fear of the checkbox and replaced it with new tooling and process that teams actually want to work with.

Speakers:

Ari Rubinstein has worked in multiple roles across the security industry including leading the Red Team at Salesforce, developing a Product Security program at Heroku, and now runs the Product Security group at Slack focusing on proactive identification, automation, and education programs. He enjoys participating in numerous bug bounties in his free time and has a special interest in Web Application Security. Ari has advised on security topics for multiple startups and has a Masters of Science from Carnegie Mellon University.

Leigh leads the security incident response team at Slack. Prior to Slack, she worked at Salesforce, Microsoft, and Symantec. She has co-founded two hackerspaces, and is an advisor to several nonprofits and startups. Leigh has a Bachelors of Science from the University of Toronto where she majored in Computer Science and Equity Studies.",Science and Technology
