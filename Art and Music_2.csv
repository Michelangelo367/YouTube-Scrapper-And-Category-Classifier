k7ngnWJ6Hks,Music is a visual art | Hunter Ewen | TEDxBoulder,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. We can use visuals to better describe music. 

Hunter Ewen is a dramatic music composer, educator, and multimedia designer. During the day, Dr. Ewen teaches strategies for digital creativity at the University of Colorado, the children‚Äôs collaborative art center Reel Kids, the City of Longmont, and as an independent educator. At night, he composes, solders, choreographs, and directs interdisciplinary projects around the world. Experimental performance practices and unusual notation figure prominently in Ewen‚Äôs works. A believer that compositions should be both seen and heard, his music looks as strange as it sounds. Swirles, squiggles, arrows, and fangs often replace traditional notes and rests. His aesthetic preferences gravitate towards yowls and yips and wails and squeals. Towards screams that masquerade as art. Towards clamor and deviance. Ewen‚Äôs music swings from chandeliers.

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",Art and Music

This talk will share a few ideas relating these multidisciplinary fields. After a brief historical review, the work performed in the lab of Prof. Rodrigues on the use of drones for light painting, and in response to improvised music will be detailed. A video performance will be shown.

Professor Rodrigues holds a PhD in Aeronautics and Astronautics from Stanford University. His research focuses on the control and trajectory planning for flying vehicles, and on the multiple connections of flying machines to performing arts. The research performed by his group has been published in several journals and has appeared in multiple venues, one of which was the recent Concordia Tedx 2017 event.

users.encs.concordia.ca/~luisrod Dr. Rodrigues is a Professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering of Concordia University and at the Concordia Institute of Aerospace Design & Innovation. He received his PhD from the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics of Stanford University in June 2002. During the last two years of his PhD research, Dr. Rodrigues worked as a visiting student at the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics of MIT. He received his Masters and his ‚Äúlicenciatura‚Äù degrees from the Technical University of Lisboa, Portugal. Prior to joining Concordia, Dr. Rodrigues worked as a consultant for speech recognition at Eliza Corporation, USA, and as a project manager for flight simulation applications at Ydreams, Portugal. Dr. Rodrigues is the founder and director of the HYbrid CONtrol Systems (HYCONS) Laboratory and the leader of the FLIght CONtrol and Simulation (FLICONS) Laboratory at Concordia University.

Songs From the Northern Territory 4: Aboriginal Music From North-Eastern Arnhem Land Including Groote Eylandt 
Artist/Collector: 
Alice Moyle 
Label Information: 
Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS): AIAS 4 CD 
Media Type: 
CD 
Year: 
Recorded 1963; Released 1997 
Availability: 
AIATSIS 

Notes: For the purpose of music description, Eastern Arnhem Land of the Northern 
Territory is divided here as follows: the north-eastern sector including offshore 
islands; the eastern sector, extending along the coast as far south as the Roper 
River; and the Groote Eylandt archipelago north-west of the Gulf of Carpentaria. 
Field recordings reproduced on this compact disc were collected at Milingimbi and 
Yirrkala in the north-eastern sector and at Angurugu and Umbakumba on Groote Eylandt.
 
The Aboriginal communities at Milingimbi and Yirrkala, together with the people at 
Galiwin'ku (previously known as Elcho Island) have been referred to in the 
anthropological literature as the Murngin (WL Warner) and Wulamba (RM Berndt). More 
recently, they have become known as the Yolngu, from a local word meaning 'people'. 
The people on Groote Eylandt were known by mainland groups as the Wayingurra and 
their language, Ingurra. In the absence of a name for the Groote Eylandters, 
Warnindilyakwa, a name formerly given to one of the larger clans on the island, is 
sometimes used. Anindilyakwa is the name of the island language. 
Item characteristics of Eastern Arnhem Land clan songs performed and recorded in 
the 1960s-all of which were sung by men-are summarised here as follows: (1) a didjeridu 
accompaniment which utilises two tones differing widely in pitch (the interval between 
the higher or overblown tone and the fundamental often sounding close to a tenth 
but varying according to the shape and length of the hollowed branch); (2) a narrow 
vocal range of pitch (compare them, for instance, with Western Arnhem Land songs) 
which rarely exceeds a fifth or sixth and may be less than a second; (3) song words 
which are translatable, meaningful and appropriate to relevant clan territories 
and related myths; and (4) the occurrence of an unaccompanied vocal termination (UVT), 
or termination of a song item by voice or voices alone after the accompanying 
instruments have ceased. Good examples of this fourth item characteristic are to be 
heard on this disc (Track 1) and disc 3 (Track 11). 
Song refrains may consist of repeated strings of words and syllables, a prolonged 
single syllable or a repeated pattern of vocal sounds (for example, bird calls). 
These calls are incorporated into the particular sectional or phraselike structure 
of many item sequences performed in Eastern Arnhem Land. 
On Groote Eylandt (tracks 7-13), only the first three of the above characteristics 
are to be heard. There is no occurrence of the UVT in these items but the following 
additional characteristics distinguish emeba (Groote Eylandt clan songs) from manikay 
(north-eastern Arnhem Land clan songs): 
a. the shaky voice, a deliberate manner of vocal ornamentation used by some emeba singers; 
b. the break or brief cessation of the vocal part of a Groote Eylandt clan song which is 
signalled by certain words the singer chooses to sing (the song subject at this point may 
fall, swoop down, or change abruptly in some way-it was said that the break gives the singer 
time to decide which words to sing next); 
c. a short, patterned interplay between sticks and didjeridu during the break; and 
d. the general clatter of stick-beating percussion arising from several different sources 
at the same time. 
Further comparison of emeba and manikay reveals that, whereas the durations of the latter 
are usually about one minute or less, emeba items may last for more than two minutes each.

daVaEoF5Hrk,Arnold Sch√∂nberg - Wassily Kandinsky: Music and Art Get One,"The early years of the 20th Century signed a terrific advance in the Physical Sciences. The Special (1905) and General (1916)  Theories of Relativity and the advent of Quantum Mechanics (1926) changed our lives profoundly. Around the same years, a similar revolution took place in both Music and Art. The year 1909 marks a decisive break with tonality (the structure of classical music) by Arnold Sch√∂nberg in his ""Three Piano Pieces"". The term 'Atonality' is commonly used to express this new type of composition. Wassily Kandinsky is credited with painting the first 'purely abstract' works. His production is vast and I could only include 20 of his works here, selected from a period of time that overlaps with the musical pieces by Sch√∂nberg presented in this video. They knew each other and have possibly influenced their works reciprocally. The video is an attempt to evince this intriguing 'connection' between music and painting.


About Arnold Sch√∂nberg (1874-1951):
...The final piece (of the Three Piano Pieces, Op.11) breaks through all constraints of traditional language or structure, cutting abruptly from extremes of eruptive power, as in the massively congested opening, to the most intense introspection. Perhaps Schoenberg had in mind Kandinsky, with whom he had close  contacts, when he likened such music to developments in painting -""without architecture... an ever-changing, unbroken succession of colours, rhythms and moods."" (From a Text by Peter Hill).

About Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944):
...As the ""Der Blaue Reiter""(*) Almanac essays and theorizing with composer Arnold Sch√∂nberg indicate, Kandinsky also expressed the communion between artist and viewer as being available to both the senses and the mind (Synesthesia). Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorized that, for instance, yellow is the colour of middle C on a brassy trumpet; black is the colour of closure, and the end of things; and that combinations of colours produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano. Kandinsky also developed a theory of geometric figures and their relationships, claiming, for example, that the circle is the most peaceful shape and represents the human soul.  (From Wikipedia).

Note Added: (*) Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) was a group of artists from the Neue √ºnstlervereinigung M√ºnchen in Munich, Germany. The group was founded by a number of Russian emigrants, including Wassily Kandinsky, Alexej von Jawlensky, Marianne von Werefkin, and native German artists, such as Franz Marc, August Macke and Gabriele M√ºnter. Der Blaue Reiter was a movement lasting from 1911 to 1914, fundamental to Expressionism, along with Die Br√ºcke which was founded in 1905.

jvYTiPQAyAE,How art and music create a new hybrid global culture: Rajae El Mouhandiz at TEDxBreda,"The ""one story"" of Muslims and immigrants we hear in the news and politics every day is ignoring the many stories of millions of women and men who do not see themselves in that old story, but as authors and owners of a new story where globalism and hybrid cultures are the stage and vehicle. They represent a new story of being and belonging in the world. A story where history is honoured as the sacrifices of those who came before us. Their parents moved to the west to start something new, mixed with the old, and individuals like Rajae El Mouhandiz are the product. As the new stories they are shaping do not yet have a language and a platform, one has to start telling the stories through art and music. And personal strength.

Regarding Rajae El Mouhandiz
Rajae El Mouhandiz is a Dutch-Moroccan-Algerian poet, singer, composer, producer, and founder of the record label Truthseeker Records. After leaving her family at age 15 and being the first Moroccan to study at a Dutch conservatory at age 16. El Mouhandiz left classical music at age 20 to follow her own artistic path, seeking to incorporate her cultural roots. She started her own record label at age 25, released two albums and is currently developing her third album in Morocco. On international women's day 2013 El Mouhandiz premiered her first short documentary film, about the acceptance of Muslim women in mainstream media and the music industry. Currently she is developing her second short film, focusing on her Maghreb heritage and the story of her grandfathers. She is also one of the 60 female curators of the groundbreaking international MUSLIMA exhibition, held in The USA, The Philipines, The U.A.E and Denmark. And together with the British Council Ireland and a Dutch theatre production company, El Mouhandiz is producing the Dutch and European version of the Hijabi Monologues; a theatre space for the experiences of Muslim women; a space to breathe as they are; a space that does not claim to tell every story and speak for every voice. The Dutch premiere is planned in September 2014. Rajae was nominated as Muslim Leader of tomorrow in 2005. She was nominated by Elsevier magazine as one of Hollands' 10 biggest talents in 2007, in the field of contemporary music and from 2009 -- 2012 she was the only female contemporary artist to be nominated on the list of the 500 most influential Muslims in the world. This year Rajae has been nominated for the 5th year in a row. More information: www.rajae.net",Art and Music

d8VA7_qSC7U,With One Voice in Montreal: Art and Music Helping Homeless People.,"""Art to me is a humanitarian act and I believe that there is a responsibility that art should somehow be able to effect mankind, to make the world a better place.""  ~ Jeff Koons

Something I don't talk about very often is that at its very core Invisible People is art. Years ago, my boss at the time had in his office a coffee table book of photos of homeless people. The pictures humanized homeless men, woman, and families as the real people that they are. I said to myself: ""I could do this with video."" Shortly after, I was laid off and Invisible People was started. If you'd like to learn more about my story and how Invisible People started, please watch this documentary https://youtu.be/z0wDn9SAWZs

Art and music have the power to bring people together and change our world for the better. Both art and music can play a huge role in giving homeless people a purpose. Yes, housing ends homelessness but just putting homeless people in boxes will never end homelessness. People need to thrive and not just survive. Art therapy and music therapy are powerful tools for wellness, and as you'll see in this vlog - art, music, and theater can be used for advocacy to help change policy. 

Last year, With One Voice sent a delegation to the ATSA √âtat d'Urgence Festival in Montreal, Canada. It was an amazing few days meeting new friends and brainstorming on how we can help other creative organizations scale to have more impact helping homeless people. I shot a bunch of footage but never got around to editing it into something until this month. My dream is someday to be able to produce mini-documentaries like this vlog highlighting cool ideas and amazing people working to end homelessness who may not always get a lot of media attention.  

For example, in this vlog, I reference a video I shot when I was invited to the Dallas Public Library that you can watch here: https://youtu.be/_SaG0xR7xkU The folks behind With One Voice saw this video and invited Jo and Heather to Montreal to share about creating safe spaces. I hope to one day be able to produce more like this but on a much larger scale! 

In her interview, Beth Knowles from the City of Manchester and With One Voice references the North America Review of Arts and Homelessness that you can find here: http://with-one-voice.com/north-america-country-review

From With One Voice's website: 

With One Voice began as a showcase event curated by Streetwise Opera at the 2012 Cultural Olympiad in London. For the first time in Olympic history, it gave a platform for homeless people ‚Äì celebrating the artistic achievements of 300 performers who had experienced homelessness.

To learn more about the people and the organizations in this video, here is a link to information about the delegates https://www.atsa.qc.ca/en/eu-2017-with-one-voice-en For more information about With One Voice, please visit their website: http://with-one-voice.com

One story at a time, videos posted on InvisiblePeople.tv shatter the stereotypes of America‚Äôs homeless, force shifts in perception and deliver a call to action that is being answered by national brands, nonprofit organizations and everyday citizens now committed to opening their eyes and their hearts to those too often forgotten.

9RQ-Ha9JmpI,"The Harlem Renaissance:  The Rise of African American Literature, Art, and Music","This short film, produced and created by Rob Johnson of San Rafael, CA,  is an introduction to an interdisciplinary unit on the Music, Art, and Literature of the Harlem Renaissance. The Harlem Renaissance (also known as the Black Literary Renaissance and the New Negro Movement) refers to the flowering of African American cultural and intellectual life during the 1920s and 1930s. At the time, it was known as the ""New Negro Movement"", named after the 1925 anthology The New Negro edited by Alain Locke. Centered in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, the movement impacted urban centers throughout the United States. Across the cultural spectrum (literature, drama, music, visual art, dance) and also in the realm of social thought (sociology, historiography, philosophy), artists and intellectuals found new ways to explore the historical experiences of black America and the contemporary experiences of black life in the urban North. Challenging white paternalism and racism, African-American artists and intellectuals rejected imitating the styles of Europeans and white Americans and instead celebrated black dignity and creativity. Asserting their freedom to express themselves on their own terms, they explored their identities as black Americans, celebrating the black culture that had emerged out of slavery, as well as cultural ties to Africa. The Harlem Renaissance had a profound impact not only on African-American culture but also on the cultures of the African diaspora. Afro-Caribbean artists and intellectuals from the British West Indies, who had migrated to New York in number, were part of the movement. Moreover, many French-speaking black writers from African and Caribbean colonies who lived in Paris were also influenced by the Harlem Renaissance.[1] Historians disagree as to when the Harlem Renaissance began and ended. It is unofficially recognized to have spanned from about 1919 until the early or mid 1930s. Many of its ideas lived on much longer. The zenith of this ""flowering of Negro literature"", as James Weldon Johnson preferred to call the Harlem Renaissance, is placed between 1924 (the year that Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life hosted a party for black writers where many white publishers were in attendance) and 1929 (the year of the stock market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression). In 1917 Hubert Harrison, ""The Father of Harlem Radicalism,"" founded the Liberty League and The Voice, the first organization and the first newspaper of the ""New Negro Movement"". Harrison's organization and newspaper were political, but also emphasized the arts (his newspaper had ""Poetry for the People"" and book review sections). In 1927, in the Pittsburgh Courier, Harrison challenged the notion of the renaissance. He argued that the ""Negro Literary Renaissance"" notion overlooked ""the stream of literary and artistic products which had flowed uninterruptedly from Negro writers from 1850 to the present"", and said the so-called ""renaissance"" was largely a white invention.

MP3 DOWNLOAD: https://www.brainwavehub.com/downloads/creativity-focus-for-writing-art-work/

Using a combination of Theta, Alpha and Beta frequencies, this audio is designed to act as an aid to your creative pursuits, encourage fluid, abstract thought processes while maintaining focus over long periods. 

The Theta / Beta frequencies range from 6-7hz & 13-15hz respectively, with 8-12hz alpha waves interspersed throughout. The patterns switch in the following manner, every 5 minutes: 

0-5 mins - Alpha / Beta; 
5-10 mins - Theta / Alpha; 
10 - 15 mins -Alpha / Beta; 
etc. etc.  up to one hour. 

This quick interplay between beta and theta/alpha promotes a balance between concrete thought and creative abstraction. This way we can encourage and bring to light new insights, generate new & original ideas, contemplate a concept from various points of view, and problem solve holistically. The beta phases serve to not only promote focus and concentration, but to also analyse, organise and therefore make sense of the abstractions derived from the more non linear holistic mind states induced by Theta and Alpha. 

In addition to using this audio during work or study, you can also use it in a rested state while meditating to assist with creative visualisation. 


As binaural beats have been integrated into this track, we recommend using headphones.

CQ4gxP2NGiQ,"Mathematics, Music, and Visual Art","Bridges 4: Mathematics, Music, and Visual Art

Our talks will explore some of the many connections between mathematics, music, and visual arts, using as a springboard our collaborative work-in-progress with the Kitchener-Waterloo symphony, to be premiered in April 2016. Dmitri will begin by describing the deep similarities between the languages of music and geometry, showing how elementary musical terms like ‚Äúchord‚Äù and ‚Äúvoice leading‚Äù correspond to geometrical concepts like ‚Äúvectors in an orbifold.‚Äù This correspondence in turn allows us to appreciate the hidden logic of particular pieces, the development of styles, and entire genres. Nathan will continue by showing how mathematical ideas can underwrite visually and conceptually striking visual art. The speakers will then join forces to describe some of the challenges and opportunities of using these ideas in creating a multimedia performance.

Nathan Selikoff plays with interactivity and motion in time and space. Inspired by the behavior of systems, science, nature, and music, he combines computer code, traditional materials, and future technology to bring new ideas to life. His award-winning artwork has been exhibited and performed in galleries and venues throughout the United States and around the world. Selikoff is represented by Snap! Space in Florida, Bangkok, and Amsterdam.

Transcript: Michael Montoya: Hi Bill. Michael Montoya here. What do you think is the evolutionary advantage to humanity being both musically and artistically creative? And where do you think this initial spark of creativity came from?

Bill Nye: Michael. Michael. This is a great question and susceptible to speculation. Apparently music and art is part of the way we communicate and it's certainly the way you attract mates. I'll just put it to you that way. Musicians and artists engage other people in a way that people who don't use music and don't use art do not. Now, there's a lot of talk about songbirds in evolutionary biology and they all have these songs, which must be pleasing to the ears of their potential mates and also must send messages to others of their species, so I guess to other species as well. I am angry; this is my territory; I'm looking for a mate; it's a sunny day. These sort of announcements are made by other species so you figure humans have just taken it just a whole other level with albums and record release parties and art exhibits and art museums and art galleries. So it really is deep within us and I think art enriches our lives, engages our brains and stimulates us in a way that nothing else we do does. So, this is only speculation on my part but music especially certainly inspires us. That's for sure. So carry on Michael. Turn it up loud.",Art and Music

Staring straight down at the sink

Cuz I can fly a million miles away
I‚Äôd still be at the same old place
I don‚Äôt need a clock to pass the time 
It‚Äôs written on my face and it‚Äôs in the line

Sudden thoughts are such a shame 
Left alone they‚Äôll just turn to gray 
A chance that you might never take 
Sinks your soul and it stamps a date

Maybe you can reach me now and again 
But I don‚Äôt think that time is a friend 
AnymoreAnymore

It‚Äôs time I get a P.O. Box 
Collect the mail that I never got 
Buy a ship and sail far away 
to the life that got away

Cuz I can fly a million miles away 
I‚Äôd still be at the same old place
I don‚Äôt need a clock to pass the time 
It‚Äôs written in my face and it‚Äôs in the lie

When I am faced with the whiteness of my creative page, I like to set limiting parameters before I begin my work. Choosing to limit my creative output can bring focus and direction. The following are a few examples of the concept of limitation:

1. Georgia O'Keeffe uses soft and wavy curves in her paintings (example: Flower of Life II)

2. Claude Debussy focuses on the pentatonic and the octatonic scales in his compositions.

3. The game of chess limits the movements of the pieces both collectively and individually.

pP0Rlw8mo8g,Is Music Art? ‚Äì Hangout on Air,"In our fifth and final 'Hangout on Air', Miranda Sawyer is joined by artist Haroon Mirza, music producer Will Skeaping, record sleeve designer Leif Podhajsky and Tate's Adrian Shaw for a lively discussion about music and art.

Miranda Sawyer is a journalist, writer and broadcaster covering a wide range of interests, including music, art, radio and theatre. She is currently a feature writer and radio critic for The Observer, and is a regular arts critic in print and on television and radio. Miranda is also on the board of Tate Members.

Haroon Mirza is a British artist who combines a variety of readymade and time based material to create audio compositions, which are often realised as site-specific installations. In doing so, Mirza complicates the distinctions between noise, sound and music, and alters the function and meaning of everyday objects and and socio-cultural constructs.

Adrian Shaw is part of Tate‚Äôs Learning department, working on the Young People‚Äôs Programme. He has been organising music events since the early 1990‚Äôs and introduced large scale music programming to Tate over 10 years ago.  Now established as ‚ÄòLate at Tate‚Äô, these events often explore the boundaries between music, performance and art.  Adrian is also a musician, and one half of the arts duo boyleANDshaw.

Will Skeaping is a creative consultant and music producer. Following a tour of duty at Google, he worked closely with rappers, authors and film makers as label manager at Lex Records, focusing on collaborations between artists and musicians. He is currently making an album uniting English folk music with vintage analogue synthesizers. 

Leif Podhajsky is an Australian artist and graphic designer, who‚Äôs distinctive bright, surreal abstractions have featured on posters and album covers for musicians including Mount Kimbie, Tame Impala, Grimes, Lykki Li and Foals. Leif says his work ‚Äúexplores themes of connectedness, the relevance of nature and the psychedelic or altered experience.‚Äù

http://bit.ly/blackstarbeatbox --~--
Sleeping. That's what we're doing every day. Asleep, following the next big thing, mindlessly chasing after the same objectives that mean nothing after we've achieved them. 

Or is there something else... Something you know, deep inside your soul, that is the one thing you've suppressed for so long, because facing reality is too hard, and so you keep that thing hidden. 

There's nothing stopping you but the conformity of society. 

Wake up.

Transcript: Michael Montoya: Hi Bill. Michael Montoya here. What do you think is the evolutionary advantage to humanity being both musically and artistically creative? And where do you think this initial spark of creativity came from?

Bill Nye: Michael. Michael. This is a great question and susceptible to speculation. Apparently music and art is part of the way we communicate and it's certainly the way you attract mates. I'll just put it to you that way. Musicians and artists engage other people in a way that people who don't use music and don't use art do not. Now, there's a lot of talk about songbirds in evolutionary biology and they all have these songs, which must be pleasing to the ears of their potential mates and also must send messages to others of their species, so I guess to other species as well. I am angry; this is my territory; I'm looking for a mate; it's a sunny day. These sort of announcements are made by other species so you figure humans have just taken it just a whole other level with albums and record release parties and art exhibits and art museums and art galleries. So it really is deep within us and I think art enriches our lives, engages our brains and stimulates us in a way that nothing else we do does. So, this is only speculation on my part but music especially certainly inspires us. That's for sure. So carry on Michael. Turn it up loud.",Art and Music
8wcFi5qEIPY,New Art/New Music at &#39;Intersections&#39;,"This fall, the New Art/New Music partnership between the Shepherd School of Music and Rice Gallery presents a program of music to complement the powerful installation ‚ÄúIntersections‚Äù by Pakistani-American artist Anila Agha. Her work, an intricately laser-cut box of wood suspended from the ceiling of the Rice Gallery, permeates the space with its cast shadows from a light inside the box. The utterly beautiful designs cut in the box are reflective of geometric patterns and ornamentation found in Islamic art and mosques. Her interactive work, inherently religious in inspiration, provides a space open to all to reflect on the all-encompassing power of beauty and spirituality. The music program echoes the spirituality and inclusivity of the art. Opening with the meditative and introspective ‚ÄúFratres‚Äù by Arvo P√§rt, the concert is followed by a work from the Shepherd School‚Äôs own Ben Morris ‚Äô17, entitled ‚ÄúMuqarnas Projections,‚Äù for three violins. The concert continues with a string quartet, ‚ÄúThe Named Angels,‚Äù by Arab-American composer Mohammed Fairouz, whose work is also influenced by Islam as well as Middle-Eastern folklore. Finally, the program concludes with a work by Karim Al-Zand, associate professor of composition and theory at the Shepherd School. His piece, ‚ÄúStudies in Nature,‚Äù is for harp, viola and flute. It is contemplation on the marriage of art and science, directly influenced by remarkably aesthetic color plates of organisms in intricate detail.

Yhif28t47qk,"Creativity Music for Writing, Art, Work etc. - Focus &amp; Creativity (With Binaural Beats)","Creativity Music for Writing, Art, Work etc. - Focus & Creativity (With Binaural Beats) 

MP3 DOWNLOAD: https://www.brainwavehub.com/downloads/creativity-focus-for-writing-art-work/

Using a combination of Theta, Alpha and Beta frequencies, this audio is designed to act as an aid to your creative pursuits, encourage fluid, abstract thought processes while maintaining focus over long periods. 

The Theta / Beta frequencies range from 6-7hz & 13-15hz respectively, with 8-12hz alpha waves interspersed throughout. The patterns switch in the following manner, every 5 minutes: 

0-5 mins - Alpha / Beta; 
5-10 mins - Theta / Alpha; 
10 - 15 mins -Alpha / Beta; 
etc. etc.  up to one hour. 

This quick interplay between beta and theta/alpha promotes a balance between concrete thought and creative abstraction. This way we can encourage and bring to light new insights, generate new & original ideas, contemplate a concept from various points of view, and problem solve holistically. The beta phases serve to not only promote focus and concentration, but to also analyse, organise and therefore make sense of the abstractions derived from the more non linear holistic mind states induced by Theta and Alpha. 

In addition to using this audio during work or study, you can also use it in a rested state while meditating to assist with creative visualisation. 


As binaural beats have been integrated into this track, we recommend using headphones.

OxI6uPQwu8I,Composer Chat 03 - Art and Music - Limitation as Freedom,"I am discussing the concept of limitation in the context of artistic freedom. When I am faced with the whiteness of my creative page, I like to set limiting parameters before I begin my work. Choosing to limit my creative output can bring focus and direction. The following are a few examples of the concept of limitation:

1. Georgia O'Keeffe uses soft and wavy curves in her paintings (example: Flower of Life II)

2. Claude Debussy focuses on the pentatonic and the octatonic scales in his compositions.

3. The game of chess limits the movements of the pieces both collectively and individually.

d8VA7_qSC7U,With One Voice in Montreal: Art and Music Helping Homeless People.,"""Art to me is a humanitarian act and I believe that there is a responsibility that art should somehow be able to effect mankind, to make the world a better place.""  ~ Jeff Koons

Something I don't talk about very often is that at its very core Invisible People is art. Years ago, my boss at the time had in his office a coffee table book of photos of homeless people. The pictures humanized homeless men, woman, and families as the real people that they are. I said to myself: ""I could do this with video."" Shortly after, I was laid off and Invisible People was started. If you'd like to learn more about my story and how Invisible People started, please watch this documentary https://youtu.be/z0wDn9SAWZs

Art and music have the power to bring people together and change our world for the better. Both art and music can play a huge role in giving homeless people a purpose. Yes, housing ends homelessness but just putting homeless people in boxes will never end homelessness. People need to thrive and not just survive. Art therapy and music therapy are powerful tools for wellness, and as you'll see in this vlog - art, music, and theater can be used for advocacy to help change policy. 

Last year, With One Voice sent a delegation to the ATSA √âtat d'Urgence Festival in Montreal, Canada. It was an amazing few days meeting new friends and brainstorming on how we can help other creative organizations scale to have more impact helping homeless people. I shot a bunch of footage but never got around to editing it into something until this month. My dream is someday to be able to produce mini-documentaries like this vlog highlighting cool ideas and amazing people working to end homelessness who may not always get a lot of media attention.  

For example, in this vlog, I reference a video I shot when I was invited to the Dallas Public Library that you can watch here: https://youtu.be/_SaG0xR7xkU The folks behind With One Voice saw this video and invited Jo and Heather to Montreal to share about creating safe spaces. I hope to one day be able to produce more like this but on a much larger scale! 

In her interview, Beth Knowles from the City of Manchester and With One Voice references the North America Review of Arts and Homelessness that you can find here: http://with-one-voice.com/north-america-country-review

From With One Voice's website: 

With One Voice began as a showcase event curated by Streetwise Opera at the 2012 Cultural Olympiad in London. For the first time in Olympic history, it gave a platform for homeless people ‚Äì celebrating the artistic achievements of 300 performers who had experienced homelessness.

To learn more about the people and the organizations in this video, here is a link to information about the delegates https://www.atsa.qc.ca/en/eu-2017-with-one-voice-en For more information about With One Voice, please visit their website: http://with-one-voice.com

About Invisible People: 

Invisible People goes beyond the rhetoric, statistics, political debates, and limitations of social services to examine poverty in America via a medium that audiences of all ages can understand, and can‚Äôt ignore. The vlog puts into context one of our nation‚Äôs most troubling and prevalent issues through personal stories captured by the lens of Mark Horvath ‚Äì its founder ‚Äì and brings into focus the pain, hardship and hopelessness that millions face each day. One story at a time, videos posted on InvisiblePeople.tv shatter the stereotypes of America‚Äôs homeless, force shifts in perception and deliver a call to action that is being answered by national brands, nonprofit organizations and everyday citizens now committed to opening their eyes and their hearts to those too often forgotten.

Invisible People is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to changing the way we think about people experiencing homelessness.",Art and Music

X3Os6vJxpu0,Classic Lute - Renaissance Art | Music Collection,"Classic Lute - Renaissance Art | Music Collection

Music Player: Unknow
Image: Artemisia Gentileschi (Self-Portrait)

No Tracklist Avaiable.

In the Renaissance era, the lute was the most popular instrument in the Western world. It became the symbol of the magic and power of music. The lute was the instrument of kings and queens, playing the sublime music of great composers. The lute was heard in the theatre in the incidental music of Shakespeare's plays. And the lute was heard by common people, playing the popular tunes of the day in pubs and on street corners.

The lute is the descendent of the Arabic Oud which traveled into Europe during the time of the Crusades. From the beginning, the lute had a pear-shaped body, a rounded back made of separate strips of wood, and a bent-back pegbox.
he Early Music movement of the late twentieth century saw a new generation of lutenists dedicated to rediscovering the old performance practices. The tremendous beauty, variety and color of Renaissance and Baroque lute music can now be heard in their performances. And the amazing musical flexibility of the lute is revealed through new compositions, written in a variety of styles. After two hundred years of neglect, the future of the lute once again looks bright.

Where dips the rocky mountains,
To a soft and winter lake,
There lies a frosty island,
Where flapping herons wake.
With the sound of soothing rhyme,
Let me sing for you a time,
Of a world so far it seems,
Can be only found in dreams.

CHORUS:
Come away, O human child,
To the beauties of the wild,
Where your sorrows melt away,
For the worlds more full of weeping,
Than ye can understand.

As the waves of moonlight beckon,
For you to join me there.
As the soft, white jasmine petals,
Drift through the snowy air,
As the sounds of silence cease,
The melody of rest brings peace,
As the purring lions dance,
In the winter-tide brilliance,
As the sky above us glows.
And no more our troubles find us,
In this land that's free of woes.

CHORUS

Where the wandering waters fountain,
In the pools across the dale,
You can eye the reindeer prancing,
To their long forgotten tales.
As they leap and jump and bound,
Our hearts beat to the sound,
Under frosted, ivory sky,
With their sparkling antlers high,
Their hoof-beats serenade,
As we ride across the glade,
Through the silvery, silken snow,
In a wintry wonderland,
With the brisk wind at our backs.
Let me take you there...

CHORUS

As you close your eyes in slumber,
May you take me by the hand.
Let us go where joy and laughter,
Ne'r cease in that fair land.",Art and Music

   http://moyaokruga.ru/niva/Articles.aspx?articleId=209215

The competition was attended by pupils of the Children's Art School, who were prepared for it's performance by conductors teachers of this institution of additional education. The concert program included 26 everything numbers. It's includes a playing on musical instruments (solo performance) and dance numbers. For the first time, the jury presented the artworks of children studying at the art department of the School of Arts, also included musical and choreographic compositions, puppet shows.

The jury, which included: a methodologist of the department for coordinating the activities of educational organizations in the region of the Saratov regional educational and methodological center N.Ye. Mikhailova, lecturer of the cyclic commission ""Choral Conducting"" of the Saratov Regional College of Arts by name O.V. Oschepkova, a teacher of the highest category of the Central Children's Music School in Saratov, Ye.G. Alferova, teacher of the highest category of the Children's Art School.by name V.V. Kovaleva municipal formation ""City of Saratov"" T.V. Chubarov.
 I had to closely monitor the performance of the participants of the competition. To say that the guys and girls were not worried would be wrong. Of course, they long time and stubbornly went to it's concert to showing their skill and talent performed at this stage.

And to look, really was what here in. The vocal and choral group by name ""Arioso"" by  woman conductor  E.S.Senckevich, always amazes with it's many tember voices and vocal singing skills, the ability to perform virtuosly work in one breath there. But this time, the guys have surpassed themselves, I'm think. 
Valentina Alontseva, Yaroslav Kisilyov, with her playing the accordion, showed how close this instrument is to them too.
 Egor Zimenkov, Ivan Stepantsov, Ali Isengaliev, Alexei Baranov with the support of teacher of children's schools by accordion class N.A. Shvydkovoy forced the viewer no breath. Polina Galitskaya, Maria Gulak, Maria Oleinikova, Sarsen Incarbekova (upright piano) and others were able to subordinate grand piano, make it laugh and sob theirs playing. The performance of Nikita Kutakhin and Andrei Kulzhanov, known as the duo ""NikAnder"", took place nice again.
The ""dance"", a children's dance group known in the region, "" has flashing"" on the dance floor, adding to the grace and plasticity the brightness of theirs costumes and owns enthusiasm that was passed to all those who came to see and support the contestants on this important day.

The jury had the opportunity to evaluate the performance of the guys from ""CANAREYKA"" original name (canary-finch) puppet theater. Although the artists themselves are not visible during the performance, they tried to convey the emotions and feelings to theirs dolls, playing as sincerely as possible so that the viewer believed in the reality of what was happening here.

Christina Skrypnyk performed in the nomination ""solo performance, vocal"". Her performance fascinated the members of the jury, and it was she who passed the final selection. Art school teachers hope that our young ‚Äústar‚Äù will take part in the gala concert, which will be held in the regional center (Saratov city). And we wish her good luck and we shall believe and hope in her victory in!

leG2P7xwEr0,Portico Quartet Performs New Music from &#39;Art In The Age Of Automation&#39; | See. Hear. Now.,"‚ñ∫¬†Subscribe to Red Bull Music: http://win.gs/SubToRedBullMusic

After a hiatus, London electronic Jazz outfit Portico Quartet has returned with a new album, and we have them in studio to play two tracks from the record, 'Endless' and 'A Luminous Beam.' Their compositions meld acoustic and electronic soundscapes, jungle-style breakbeats and loose percussive grooves. As the title of current album ""Art In The Age Of Automation"" suggests, they're not interested in musical regression, but rather in ""What it means to make music in the modern age, to mix human art and computer art.""

Transcript: Michael Montoya: Hi Bill. Michael Montoya here. What do you think is the evolutionary advantage to humanity being both musically and artistically creative? And where do you think this initial spark of creativity came from?

Bill Nye: Michael. Michael. This is a great question and susceptible to speculation. Apparently music and art is part of the way we communicate and it's certainly the way you attract mates. I'll just put it to you that way. Musicians and artists engage other people in a way that people who don't use music and don't use art do not. Now, there's a lot of talk about songbirds in evolutionary biology and they all have these songs, which must be pleasing to the ears of their potential mates and also must send messages to others of their species, so I guess to other species as well. I am angry; this is my territory; I'm looking for a mate; it's a sunny day. These sort of announcements are made by other species so you figure humans have just taken it just a whole other level with albums and record release parties and art exhibits and art museums and art galleries. So it really is deep within us and I think art enriches our lives, engages our brains and stimulates us in a way that nothing else we do does. So, this is only speculation on my part but music especially certainly inspires us. That's for sure. So carry on Michael. Turn it up loud.",Art and Music

N0u04EqNVjo,The Art of Punk - Black Flag - Art + Music - MOCAtv,"On the first episode of ""The Art of Punk"" we dissect the art of the legendary Black Flag. From the iconic four bars symbols, to the many coveted and collected gig flyers, singles, and band t-shirts, all depicting the distinctive Indian ink drawn image and text by artist Raymond Pettibon. We start off in Los Angeles talking to two founding members singer Keith Morris, and bass player Chuck Dukowski, about what the scene was like in 1976 - setting the stage for the band's formation, as well as the bands name, and the creation of the iconic four bars symbol. Raymond Pettibon talks with us from his New York art studio. Back in LA we meet with Flea, from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, about how the art, the music, and that early LA scene impacted his own life and career. To wrap it all up we sit and talk at length, with Henry Rollins, at MOCA Grand Ave in Los Angeles, about all of the above and more. 


Created, directed, and Executive Produced by writer/author of 'Fucked Up + Photocopied', Bryan Ray Turcotte (Kill Your Idols), and Bo Bushnell (The Western Empire), The Art Of Punk traces the roots of the punk movement and the artists behind the iconic logos of punk bands such as: Black Flag (Raymond Pettibon), The Dead Kennedys (Winston Smith), and Crass (Dave King).

In addition to profiling the artists, the series includes intimate interviews with former band members, notable artists, and celebrities who have been heavily influenced by the art of punk rock including Jello Biafra, Tim Biskup, Scott Campbell, Chuck Dukowski, Flea, Steve Olson, Penny Rimbaud, Henry Rollins, Owen Thornton, and Gee Vaucher.

The filmmakers Bryan Ray Turcotte and Bo Bushnell take a unique approach to exploring the rich histories of these three seminal punk legends by focusing on the influential imagery and seeking out stories that have not been told yet through the artwork, which is integral to the importance and influence of each band.

On June 11, 2013 The Art Of Punk debuts on MOCAtv with an episode on Raymond Pettibon and the artwork of Black Flag. The stories behind the art of the Dead Kennedys will debut on June 18, and June 25 will see the release of the Crass episode, all of which will be available at: www.youtube.com/MOCAtv

ZBaPihciLdU,ART IN FUSION TV - POP ART AND POP MUSIC EXHIBITION 2018 BY JORDI CASALS,"VISIT THE AMAZING POP ART AND POP MUSIC EXHIBITION IN BORMES LES MIMOSAS _ SOUTH OF FRANCE.



This exhibition , orchestrated by the  Collector Jordi Casals ,Will present from 350 to 400 items (parts,plays) of Collection representing the links between the Pop art and the Pop Music.
Bormes Mimosas will pay a vibrant tribute to the artists, painters and sculptors of the ‚Äúpop culture‚Äù
The museum will show many rare items in ‚Äúlimited edition‚Äù, the main attraction being the clone sculpture of Michael Jackson ‚Äúthe king of pop‚Äù created by Jean-Baptiste Seckler and Adrien Saada. 
The walls of the museum will be covered with old issues of iconic magazines like ""Times"", ""Look"", ""Rolling Stones"", ""Paris
Match"", ""Beaux Arts"", ""Interview""...
More than 200 pictures ,engraving, lithography‚Äôs , screen-printing‚Äôs and paintings from the main artists of the 60‚Äô and 80‚Äô,like Erro, will give the beat to this very Pop exhibition.
The exhibition will show the different faces, aspects of the artists who influenced and immortalized this era.
The visitors will be ‚Äúrocked‚Äù through the heartbeat of this singular exhibition with the music and the videos that will be played in the museum, creating this ‚Äúpop‚Äù feeling.
Encart : This event celebrates the 90th anniversary of Andy Warhol's birth, the 60th anniversary of Michael Jackson's birth as well as the 50th anniversary of May, 1968.
P O P A R T & P O P M U S I C
Two sides of the same coin
For the first time the link between pop art and pop music will be demonstrate in the museum of arts and history of Bormes les mimosas.
The exhibition evolves around three great ‚Äúheroes‚Äùof the pop culture .
Andy Warhol, Salvador Dali and Michael Jackson had many common points.
They had their own magazines and did the cover for ‚ÄúTime magazine‚Äù or Playboy.
These three artists are considered like kings or popes in the field of music and arts, they have their own wax statues in ‚Äúle mus√©e Gr√©vin‚Äù,their own fragrances, stamps and they have also played in TV commercials
The legacy that  Michael Jackson, Andy Warhol et Salvador Dali have left behind is outstanding.
The museum will show during the ‚Äú Pop art & Pop music‚Äù exhibition , a huge amount of photos and pictures , like witnesses of this great heritage
Dali, a reference for Michael Jackson
Everybody knows that Dali is the creator of self-promotion , Thanks to his unusual behavior, he was always in the center of journalists' attention, and the relations with media were the important part of the artist`s self-branding. These surrealistic happenings have inspired most of the great show business artists.
So, for the first time in France the connection , the similitude and the influence that Dali had upon Jackson will be shown.
Both geniuses have suffered from the same kind of curse , the feeling of being the substitute of their born dead older brother . Effectively , after the death of a previous child , Dali‚Äôs and Jackson‚Äôs parents have decided to make another one immediately , a heavy burden to carry for the young Salvador and Michael.
Dali, all along his life, talked about this trauma , which led him to this constant need of being different, of being the main attraction.
Michael Jackson , though performing in a different field of art , walked the same kind of path, and also had this need to be different, even from his own brothers , this need to lead his own life and career away from ‚Äúthe Jackson five‚Äù.

pP0Rlw8mo8g,Is Music Art? ‚Äì Hangout on Air,"In our fifth and final 'Hangout on Air', Miranda Sawyer is joined by artist Haroon Mirza, music producer Will Skeaping, record sleeve designer Leif Podhajsky and Tate's Adrian Shaw for a lively discussion about music and art.

Miranda Sawyer is a journalist, writer and broadcaster covering a wide range of interests, including music, art, radio and theatre. She is currently a feature writer and radio critic for The Observer, and is a regular arts critic in print and on television and radio. Miranda is also on the board of Tate Members.

Haroon Mirza is a British artist who combines a variety of readymade and time based material to create audio compositions, which are often realised as site-specific installations. In doing so, Mirza complicates the distinctions between noise, sound and music, and alters the function and meaning of everyday objects and and socio-cultural constructs.

Adrian Shaw is part of Tate‚Äôs Learning department, working on the Young People‚Äôs Programme. He has been organising music events since the early 1990‚Äôs and introduced large scale music programming to Tate over 10 years ago.

2MhjkAbF00U,Art x Music: Sound artist Haroon Mirza and Dave Maclean (Django Django),"Sound artist Haroon Mirza discusses the relationship between fine art and electronic music with Dave Maclean, the drummer and producer of indie band Django Django who has recently remixed Mirza's sound works under the moniker of Jellyman to create a dancefloor track that has been released by The Vinyl Factory.

Alongside Factory Floor who also reworked Mirza's experiments for release by The Vinyl Factory, Jellyman's remix explores the liminal space between art and music, which both Maclean and Mirza believe is more a matter of context than classification. 

Riffing on similar themes during this revealing conversation, Dave and Haroon discuss the role of musicians in gallery spaces, the aesthetics of Kraftwerk and Detroit techno and the ways in which Haroon's turntable experiments reflect a broader trend in DIY DJ culture to doctor and modify records to create live loops and samples.

qBERpxQ5wwA,Ronnie Wood: Art and Music exhibition opens,"On March 28th, Ronnie Wood: Art and Music opens at the William Benton Museum of Art at the University of Connecticut.  This exhibition features an exciting selection of early work as well as very recent work by Ronnie and includes a number of portraits of The Rolling Stones. 

Created from an insider's perspective, Ronnie portrays his colleagues, his friends, and band-mates, both in group portraits and individually, with an insight and intimacy not accessible to anyone else. Through line and colour, he deftly captures the creative energy of his musical world, showing us a view different from what we might see in the concert hall or arena. Ronnie Wood is one of those rare artists who can express himself through both music and the visual arts, eloquently and expertly.

lyrics:
Lyrics: Caravanserai


A gentle breeze or lightning..This glancing life is like a morning star..
A setting sun, or rolling waves at sea in a storm..
A dancing dream of all eternity..

The sand was shimmering in the morning light
And dancing off the dunes so far away..
The night held music so sweet, so long
And there we lay until the break of day..

We woke that morning at the onward call
Our camels bridled up, our howdahs full
The sun was rising in the eastern sky..
Just as we set out to the desert's cry

Calling, yearning, pulling, home to you..

The tents grew smaller as we rode away..
On earth that tells of many passing days..
The months of peace and all the years of war
The lives of love and all the lives of fears..

Calling, yearning, pulling, home to you...

We crossed the river beds all etched in stone
And up the mighty mountains ever known
Beyond the valleys in the searing heat
Until we reached the caravanserai...

Calling, yearning, pulling, home to you
Calling, yearning, pulling, home to you...

What is this life that pulls me far away..
What is that home where we cannot reside..
What is that quest that pulls me onward
My heart is full when you are by my side...

Calling, yearning, pulling, home to you....",Art and Music

XCRbISUfU2Y,Convergence 2016: Electronic Music + Visual Art,"When it comes to Electronic Music + Visual Art, we have entered into a post-instrument era in which music and visual art born of technology produce contemporary, dynamic and convergent new forms. Traditional apparatus and techniques are displaced by computer based processes, virtual instruments, electronic hardware and custom machines, stems, patches, waveforms and midi. This inaugural residency welcomes artists working in rhythmic and experimental electronic music realms, digital visual artists, and those pursuing work that creates synergies between sound, music and art.

This Banff Centre residency provided the context for artists to research, conceive, prototype and present new artistic works, tools, techniques and perspectives for electronic music, sound, and visual creation. Under the artistic direction of Patti Schmidt and Jen Mizuik, and led by faculty Robin Fox and Uwe Schmidt with guest faculty who are specialists in their fields, the program offered sessions and workshops on modular synthesizers, electronic music software and hardware, visual creation software and methods, artistic process and philosophy, and the nature of live performance in these technologically dominated fields. Together artists, peers, and world-renowned faculty exchanged knowledge, discussed ideas, experimented with processes, created, collaborated, performed, and shared artistic experiences.

Artists presented their works-in-progress throughout the program. The nature of the practices involved determined the presentation format and ranged from live performances, informal presentations, installations, talks and workshops. Artists received technical and artistic guidance during the development of their projects and research. This video gives a glimpse into the coolness that was the 2016 Convergence Residency.

Sleeping. That's what we're doing every day. Asleep, following the next big thing, mindlessly chasing after the same objectives that mean nothing after we've achieved them. 

Or is there something else... Something you know, deep inside your soul, that is the one thing you've suppressed for so long, because facing reality is too hard, and so you keep that thing hidden. 

There's nothing stopping you but the conformity of society. 

Wake up.

8wcFi5qEIPY,New Art/New Music at &#39;Intersections&#39;,"This fall, the New Art/New Music partnership between the Shepherd School of Music and Rice Gallery presents a program of music to complement the powerful installation ‚ÄúIntersections‚Äù by Pakistani-American artist Anila Agha. Her work, an intricately laser-cut box of wood suspended from the ceiling of the Rice Gallery, permeates the space with its cast shadows from a light inside the box. The utterly beautiful designs cut in the box are reflective of geometric patterns and ornamentation found in Islamic art and mosques. Her interactive work, inherently religious in inspiration, provides a space open to all to reflect on the all-encompassing power of beauty and spirituality. The music program echoes the spirituality and inclusivity of the art. Opening with the meditative and introspective ‚ÄúFratres‚Äù by Arvo P√§rt, the concert is followed by a work from the Shepherd School‚Äôs own Ben Morris ‚Äô17, entitled ‚ÄúMuqarnas Projections,‚Äù for three violins. The concert continues with a string quartet, ‚ÄúThe Named Angels,‚Äù by Arab-American composer Mohammed Fairouz, whose work is also influenced by Islam as well as Middle-Eastern folklore. Finally, the program concludes with a work by Karim Al-Zand, associate professor of composition and theory at the Shepherd School. His piece, ‚ÄúStudies in Nature,‚Äù is for harp, viola and flute. It is contemplation on the marriage of art and science, directly influenced by remarkably aesthetic color plates of organisms in intricate detail.

5TuwrYc8EDQ,"Conceptual Art, Writing, and Music with Gage McWeeny and David Lang","Conceptualism not only exists in the visual arts, but also in literature and music. Williams College Professor Gage McWeeny (Ph.D., English and American Literature, Princeton University) has devoted part of his career to the study of twentieth century and contemporary, experimental, or conceptual writing and art. Using Sol LeWitt's wall drawings as a connection to conceptualism in literature, McWeeny sheds light on the writings of Andy Warhol, Kenneth Goldsmith, and others.

David Lang, Pulitzer Prize winning composer for the ""Little Match Girl Passion"" (2008) and co-founder of the musical group Bang on a Can, will also make similar connections between Sol LeWitt's art and his own conceptualist and modernist compositions, as well as the conceptual music of Steve Reich and Tom Johnson.

This lecture took place on July 18, 2013.

bxhPwMNZpgY,Wingmakers Music &amp; Art,"There is something about this artwork and music  that touches one's soul. This particular piece (as with the others found at the Ancient Arrow site) is very busy, almost overwhelming to the eye.  I have tried to break it down for the eye and then put it back together again. The idea behind the paintings is that there is meaning in the symbols and there is communication that is going on at a deeper (subconscious?) level than we may readily perceive with our limited senses. The meaning of this piece is left up to the viewer and that is how it is and should be with all good art /music and myth I might add.  The work, for me, has spiritual meaning, yet if I was asked to tell you what exactly this piece is about, I could not. There is something sensual here to my ears and eyes, a multi-course feast (if you will) that the Creator (James?)  has brought together. This art and music is rumored to be from 'another universe.' It is modified (or somewhat diluted)  from the original because we don't have the same capabilities to perceive it display it and/or recreate it that the beings who created it have developed over eons. For instance, it is said that the pictures move or come alive when viewed in the individual chambers where they were found. Few have witnessed it . It is music and art that supposedly activates long dormant parts of our DNA, DNA that was intentionally genetically manipulated or altered by beings from other parts of the universe many thousands of years ago. Some on earth might have called them ""gods."" This is an ongoing, unfolding project designed by it's creators, the Lyricus teaching order, to open us up to dimensions we have here-to-fore not experienced. I am told we are now on the threshold of being ready for at least part of the information it can impart. The music and art here are from the Ancient Arrow site see: www.wingmakers.com also see www.Lyricus.org.",Art and Music

Original music for #GeekandSundry's #CriticalRole

SO this piece took research to pull off, I'd read that Matt had based a lot of Wildemount's culture off of real life Eastern European examples and I remember hearing a while back that his favourite instrument was violin so I implemented a mix of Eastern European folk music (Polish, Hungarian, etc.) into a very rhythmic orchestral. I'd started this piece a few days prior to the first episode so the fact that they're using music from the Witcher series actually coincides quite well with this. You may have noticed but I also worked Jason Charles Miller's original main theme into the ending and a violin passage mixed in with my own theme. 

I'll go into a more in depth analysis if enough people want to know how this was made.",Art and Music

To4otpsabSk,Whimsical Art and Music,"The beautiful artwork is by AgnesPterry on deviantart. :) She's a very sweet lady and has lovely art on her page here: 
http://agnespterry.deviantart.com/

The song, ""Ay Waukin, O"" is set to Robert Burns poem by the same name.  It's in four part harmony, for womens choir.

This recording features my voice (from several years back now) overdubbed, with some reverb, to create a pseudo choir effect.  My voice sounds thin to me now, as it was still maturing when I created this.  (I ought to re-sing this someday, maybe.  :) 

Thanks for watching, I hope you enjoy!  If you want to check out more music, you can find me at vardamusic.com.

Here are the lyrics:

Ay, Waukin, O
Waukin still and weary
Sleep I can get nane
For thinkin' on my dearie
Ay, Waukin, O

Simmer's a pleasant time
Flowers of every colour
The water rins o'er the heugh
And I long for my true lover

Ay, Waukin, O
Waukin still and weary
Sleep I can get nane
For thinkin' on my dearie

When I sleep I dream
When I wauk I'm eerie
Sleep I can get nane
For thinkin' on my dearie

Ay, Waukin, O
Waukin still and weary
Sleep I can get nane
For thinkin' on my dearie

Lanely night comes on
A' the lave are sleepin'

And I bleer my een wi' greetin'

President Leon Botstein of Bard College steps boldly into the fray to answer one of the most enduring human questions: What is art? This discussion spills over into debates about art's value to society ---- whether access to the arts is right as basic as education or health care, and whether it should be assessed and supported by government or left to the ""invisible hand"" of the free market. President Botstein explains why it is essential to ask these questions and offers a sturdy basis for evaluating them. He goes so far as to suggest that engaging with art can give our lives meaning and purpose. Ôªø

SzTaU5YI3oo,The Art of Improvisation: Inspiration and Meaning for Music,"""How many people have skinned their knees when they were playing as a kid?"" It's a question that Christopher Azzara, Professor of Music Education at the Eastman School of Music, likes to ask his students. ""If you didn't skin your knee, you weren't playing hard enough.""

It's a notion that puts in perspective his approach to teaching music, particularly teaching students how to improvise when it's outside their comfort zone. The message is, it's okay to make mistakes. From Azzara's perspective, it's the mistakes that sometimes allow students to learn the most.

Azzara has been teaching undergraduate and graduate students at Eastman these skills for years, drawing from his own background as a jazz musician where improvisation is at the core of the art form. Many of his students come from a classical background, and while their musical abilities are well defined, they may not have had many opportunities to improvise. Azzara's passion and easy-going manner allow them the freedom to explore what can be foreign territory for some of his students without fear of failure.

When Howard Potter, director of the Eastman Community Music School, approached Azzara about teaching a series of public workshops on improvisation, it seemed like a perfect fit. The approach for these workshops is the same as with the Eastman students, but the range of ages, abilities, background and instruments is much wider.

Some of the people that show up to the free workshops are in elementary school, some are years into their retirement, and there is everything in between. Some show up with a violin and years of lessons, others come with a banjo that was picked up as a hobby. For Azzara, the variety of people that attend these workshops is part of the beauty. That diversity can only enhance the learning experience from his viewpoint.

HysDgonGMCI,Art and Music are Antidotes to Intolerance: Shubha Mudgal,"Shubha Mudgal, noted composer and singer of Hindustani classical music as well as an archivist of enterprises, has launched initiatives like www.sangeetkosh.net and www.underscorerecords.com with partner Aneesh Pradhan. Most of all a voice of resistance and protest, Shubha speaks to Communalism Combat about her personal journey. As a young student who grew up in the rich cultural and academic milieu of Allahabad, Shubha began with kathak dancing, worked as a broadcaster with All India Radio and from the proceeds of her hard earned work bought her first tanpura.  Shubha then trained in Hindustani classical music under Pandit Ramashreya Jha in Allahabad, later Pandit Vinay Chandra Maudgalya in Delhi.

In this free-wheeling conversation with Teesta Setalvad, she speaks of the rich values of diversity that the Hindustani music and arts culture encapsulates, also recalling wonderful anecdotes of how leaders of the national movement like Nehru and Gandhi involved a vast array of Indians, including less visible citizens to participate in the ousting of British rule.

Keen on art and music education being introduced to Indian children at a young age, she recounts how her own personal experience of these rich and diverse worlds opened doors of the mind and heart. ‚ÄòArt and music are antidotes to intolerance‚Äô says Shubha, firmly endorsing the strong creative protests across the length and breadth of the country.

Shubha Mudgal is a regular part of SAHMAT‚Äôs January 1 celebrations every year. She speaks of the transformative experience of performing there. SAHMAT was formed after the brutal killing of Safdar Hashmi twenty-six years ago. On January 1, 1989, 34 year old Safdar Hashmi, poet, playwright and political activist with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) was beaten up by hoodlums belonging to the Congress party led by Mukesh Sharma while attempting to stage a play at Jhandapur in Sahibabad. He died from his injuries the next day. SAHMAT soon emerged as a strong artist and academic collective against the voices of authoritarianism and communalism.

On February 27, 2012, Shubha Mudgal performed at Gulberg Society as part of the tenth memorial of the Gujarat genocide. Her stage was the roof of a house where 19 people were killed. Those that soaked up the renderings of Shubha, Aneesh Pradhan and Sudhir Patwardhan were over 1,000 survivors of the pogrom from all over Gujarat along with human rights defenders.

She ends with the vocal rendering of Sahir Ludhianvi, ‚ÄúAao koi khwaab bune kal ke waste‚Ä¶‚Äù

--------------------

This week i assembled the most gorgeous machined Aluminium Bearing Housings Made by Alexcnc from the MMX Team.
They are adjustable for the Depthing of the gears. We are also implementing the new PBS - Product Breakdown System for the Whole MMX. Chris, the new project manager has introduced me to the sacred lands of Excel heaven and although there is a lot of initial work we have to do to make this function properly, the long term efficiency will improve a lot! We are taking the MMX from being a one off DIY maker project to being a scalable, fully fledged - ready to build for any competent group of people - machine. Its really great! 

Enjoy and have a great day!

VI2NT4qX4bE,"STANDPOINT THEORIES - LIVE MUSIC, DANCE, VISUAL ART AND TEXT COLLABORATION","Standpoint Theories is a collaboration between dancer Emily Navarra, musicians Bryon Ramsey-Leonard Rudd and David Moses Haimovich known as Space Panther, media artists Daniel Long and Le Thanh Tung a.k.a. Crazy Monkey featuring writer Matt Bender. 

Art work via introduction: Justin Khuong of Nhong 

Videographer: Pierre Ogeron

This projects preparation began in December of 2011 by researching the standpoint theory.  This theory concerns the authority generated by people's knowledge and the power such authority has to shape people's opinions in daily life. Standpoint theory's most important concept is that an individual's own perspectives are shaped by his or her experiences in social locations and social groups.",Art and Music

lDnnT5l3hHk,"Camille Paglia: Art and American Culture, Essays, History, Film, Music - Speech","Camille Anna Paglia (English: /Ààp…ëÀêli…ô/; born April 2, 1947) is an American academic and social critic. Paglia has been a professor at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, since 1984.

Paglia is critical of the influence modern French writers have had on the humanities, claiming that universities are in the ""thrall"" of French post-structuralists;[57] that in the works of Jean Baudrillard, Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan and Michel Foucault, she never once found a sentence that interested her;[58] and that post-structuralism has broken the link between the word and the thing, and thus endangers the Western canon.[59] Fran√ßois Cusset writes that Paglia, like other major American public intellectuals after World War II, owes her broader recognition mainly to the political repercussions of polemics that first erupted on college campuses, in her case to a polemic against foreign intellectualism. He says she achieved phenomenal success when she called Foucault a ""bastard"", thereby providing (together with Alan Sokal's Social Text parody) the best evidence for Paul de Man's view that theory should be defined negatively, based on the opposition it arouses.[60] However, Paglia's assessment of French writers is not purely negative. She has called Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex (1949) ""brilliant"", and identified Jean-Paul Sartre's work as part of a high period in literature. Paglia has praised Roland Barthes' Mythologies (1957) and Gilles Deleuze's Masochism: Coldness and Cruelty (1967), while finding both men's later work flawed. Of Gaston Bachelard, who influenced Paglia, she wrote ""[his] dignified yet fluid phenomenological descriptive method seemed to me ideal for art"", adding that he was ""the last modern French writer I took seriously"".

fLgFtLLld4E,Math + Art = Music | Justin  Davis | TEDxProvidence,"From the foundation of exchanging knowledge through communication, Justin weaves dancing, music, and art into the conversation with his talk turned performance. 

Justin Davis is a multi-talented performing artist who specializes in music, dance, and poetry. In 2011 Davis became cofounder and president of SPOKEN, a Rhode Island College student club for spoken-word poets and other artists. He also performs original songs and covers before live audiences throughout the State of Rhode Island and teaches dance throughout Rhode Island and Massachusetts. A youth development major with minors in dance and jazz studies, Davis hopes to integrate literacy with the arts. He envisions a program where theater students learn to write scripts, spoken-word poets learn to write poetry, musicians learn to write lyrics and choreographers learn to write about their concepts.

This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx",Art and Music

First we transcribe by ear from my teacher's playing of the bass and melody on the piano. Then, with his help, we arrange it for four voices according to the rules of the common practice as shown in the video.  Sorry about the shaky camera.

v-toMaehfmQ,Strange Interactive Art Installation of Musical Instrument Inventions - Music Box Roving Village,"When the Music Box Roving Village  is installed in a new location they change and add new instruments so when you see it it won't look the same or have the same instruments as you see in this documentary -  This documentary exhibits strange musical instruments invented by the New Orleans Airlift collaboration.  It's an amazing installation a village of portable sculpture dwellings that double as musical instruments.  The walls literally make music. Musicians famous and not so famous perform concerts and then the public is invited to jam on the creations. Any one young and old can play! Airlift programming highlights our city's underground art and under-the-radar artists, transporting the dynamic street culture, living folk culture and growing contemporary arts scene of New Orleans to far-flung locations around the world for exhibitions, workshops, festivals, performances, and collaborative projects.

Airlift also brings influential artists from abroad to participate in collaborative endeavors with local artists in our own community. We believe that collaboration between artists and across communities shares resources, empowers learning and unites disparate groups in common and powerful goals.
New Orleans Airlift is an artist-driven initiative that collaborates and creates alongside the artists and communities we support.

Airlift was founded in 2008 by musician and artist manager Jay Pennington and Delaney Martin, a multi-media installation artist, as a response to the unparalleled destruction of Hurricane Katrina and its devastating aftermath which left local artists, like all New Orleanians, struggling for their lives and livelihoods.

Jay and Delaney recognized a need for new audiences who could support these artists as they rebuilt their city. They dreamt up a one-time project that took city artists to Berlin and called it The New Orleans Airlift after the Berlin Airlift of WWII. Other exchange projects that used an import/export model and a multidisciplinary approach soon followed and the name stuck.

New Orleans is the last great bastion of living folk culture in the United states. Airlift projects honor tradition alongside innovation, leading our artists, culture and communities in meaningful new directions.

 Special Head Levitation
He is  best known for his appearances on America‚Äôs Got Talent in 2013 /2014 and subsequent viral videos of his Levitation acts. His America's Got talent performances were viewed by more than 40 million people on YouTube alone!

""The popularity amongst Children across America following my viral appearances really inspired me, That I've been given an opportunity to be a good roll model for kids. Thats a great reason to wake up in morning"" -Wolverton
""My artistic Vision is greatly influenced by my upbringing in the Native American Peyote Way Church and the Baha'i Faith. I realized that  1,000 years ago all art, performance, music, and dance was done through spiritual inspiration. The original performances were ritual and Ceremony. It wasn't until the Renaissance  that making a living through art became more widespread. Through my performances I intend to bring us back to an age of mysticism. Reminding people that performance is a ritual and that magic can be spiritual. 

The Special Head show goes beyond a traditional magic show. Not only does Wolverton perform Music while simultaneously performing magic illusions, Wolverton also incorporates thought provoking theatrics into his many acts. Danny uses illusions to cause the viewer to question ""what it means to be human."" His show is flexible and can be adapted to entertain many different age groups.

The Anarchestra is set up as an interactive art installation that the public gets to play. It can be tuned all to the same key making it hard to hit the wrong notes. You don't have to be a good musician to play it.

Up7TerdRqYw,"A Symphony of Science, Music and Art | Ramya Mohan | TEDxRVCE","Dr.Ramya Mohan brings together two elements which most people consider different, science and art. Music and art can be healing to the body and mind and she paints a beautiful picture for us showing how the two can come together in the form of the 'Creative Mind'. She strongly believes in the therapeutic power of music and uses it to aid recovery from illness. Dr. Ramya Mohan is a psychiatrist, artist, analyst, musician and an educator who is bridging the gap between neuroscience, mental health and creative arts to support brains better. Trained and qualified at both India and the UK, Dr. Mohan specializes in Child and Adult Psychiatry. An Autism champion for the South Surrey Autism board, Dr Mohan is passionate about bringing art and music together with the mind. In 2015, Dr Mohan founded iMANAS London, an organisation which aims to promote the integration of medicine, arts and neuroscience. A highly skilled artist and musician, Dr. Mohan travels the world as an invited guest speaker to discuss her work; her artworks have been displayed in exhibitions in both the UK and India. A formally trained Carnatic and Hindustani singer, Dr. Mohan believes in the therapeutic power of music and uses it to aid recovery from illness.

Capoeira is a Brazilian martial art that combines elements of dance and music. It was created in Brazil mainly by descendants of African slaves with Brazilian native influences, probably beginning in the 16th century. It is known by quick and complex moves, using mainly power, speed, and leverage for leg sweeps.
The word capoeira probably comes from Tupi, referring to the areas of low vegetation in the Brazilian interior.

1IEHGSLwNmQ,"Yoga of Bass - Workshops on Music, Dance, Art and Spirituality with FreQ Nasty and Claire Thompson","The Yoga of Bass is an ongoing discussion and series of workshops by DJ FreQ Nasty (Darin McFadyen) and Claire Thompson on the intersection of Music, Arts and Spirituality.

Yo-ga [Yoh-guh] ‚Äì a practice or discipline.

Bass [Beys] ‚Äì pertaining to the deepest part of music

Examples include:
anything from a discussion of the Ecstasy of Music, given in a nightclub before we rave out, to a workshop comparing the artistic and creative paths, to a weekend of in-depth teachings on the Yoga Sutras or Buddhist Meditation.

The Yoga of Bass talk specifically, which Darin and Claire have offered in the United States, Canada, England and Australia at yoga studios, art spaces, dance clubs, and festivals including Wanderlust Yoga Festival, Lightning in a Bottle, Symbiosis, and Glade, looks at the parallels between the ecstatic, life-changing experiences people have on the dance floor with music, and the peak states of meditation as experienced on the path of Yoga.

Using personal and musical examples from their lives as DJ, singer, meditation teachers and Yogis alongside explanations from the foundational texts of Yoga and Buddhism, Darin and Claire explore how a yogic and spiritual practice can help you bring this feeling of ecstacy, unity and inter-connectedness off the dance floor and into your life.

Darin McFadyen is music producer and international touring DJ FreQ Nasty. He has remixed and/or collaborated with artists as diverse as Kelis, Santigold, Fatboy Slim, Bassnectar, KRS One, avant classical composer Steve Reich and reggae legend Jnr Delgado. He has been practicing Yoga for 13 years and has studied the great texts of Yoga and Buddhism with Venerable Sumati Marut (www.lamamarut.org). He has also completed a 200-Hour Classics of Yoga Philosophy course with the Yoga Studies Institute (www.yogastudiesinstitute.org) and the 18 Foundational and 18 Advanced courses in Tibetan Buddhism offered by Asian Classics Institute, Los Angeles. Hear his music at: www.FreQNasty.com.

Claire Thompson has been practicing yoga for 7 years and massage therapy for 13 years. She has received the 200-hour Classics of Yoga training through the Yoga Studies Institute, and has completed the 18 Foundational and 18 Advanced courses in Tibetan Buddhism with Venerable Sumati Marut and the Asian Classics Institute (www.acidharma.org).

QgPEaC1WECM,Abstract Art from Music,"Disclaimer: I am not an abstract painter. I was put in Abstract Painting as a random choice of the school my first semester. I prefer draw from observation:meaning realistic drawing. 

Project was to listen to some music and interpret colors and abstract forms from the music. I chose my friend Eli's song 'Ukulele Fun' that he put together one day when he decided to pick up the uke and cello (crazy talented musician)
But as I see stories through music, this proved difficult; I don't see blobs, I see people and scenes. But I did my best to try and turn my brain off. 
Thought it would be less of a chore if I was filming it, because everything looks better in fast forward motion!! :}

ZM80F_J-QHE,Bj”ßrk - Mutual Core - OFFICIAL - Art + Music - MOCAtv,"In ""Mutual Core,"" recorded by Bj√∂rk for her seventh album Biophilia, the earth's geology is a metaphor for human relationships. Eruptions and earthquakes, the building of continents, the formation of mountain ranges and oceanic trenches: all are powerful signs of the earth's structure and mechanics. Represented musically by the violent interruption of block rocking beats, video director Andrew Thomas Huang here depicts the push and pull of tectonic plates with anthropomorphized rocks, lava and sand encircling Bj√∂rk in dance, their psychedelic innards resembling the frayed strands of a Fritz Haeg rug.

P5kHf0LhIm8,How to be Creative - Developing Creativity - Art Music Writing etc.,"How to be Creative - Developing Creativity and Productivity - Art Music Writing etc.

In this video, I talk about how to be creative and create better projects by using two different types of thinking. For creative insights, I recommend what I call creative mod. Then, when you actually create, you go into editing mode. But it's important not to mix up these two thought processes.

Creativity and productivity are the two things needed to create a work of art. Many people spend forever in creative mode where new creative insights come up, but they never develop the productivity skills to bring those ideas to the world. On the other side, there are people who have created such a rigid system for creation that the editing related tasks completely nullify the ability for creative insights to come about. 

This process should work with many different art forms including but not limited to:

Drawing
Painting
Sculpture
Writing 
Video Creation
Animation
Design
Film
Music

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (27 January 1756 ‚Äì 5 December 1791) was a prolific and influential composer of the classical era.
Born in Salzburg, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court, but grew restless and traveled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35. The circumstances of his early death have been much mythologized.

He composed more than 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote: ""posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years"".

Z11No_5QgEQ,"THE ART, ARCHITECTURE AND MUSIC OF PRAGUE  - Art Nouveau (5 of 5) Edward Saunders","THE ART, ARCHITECTURE AND MUSIC OF PRAGUE (Lecture 5 of 5)

Edward Saunders, freelance lecturer

LECTURE TITLES

1.  The city emerges
2.  Emperor Charles IV and the golden age of Bohemia
3.  Jan Hus, Emperor Rudolf II and Saint John of Nepomuk
4.  Baroque splendour and extravagance
5.  Alphonse Mucha and Czech Art Nouveau

Prague is one of the most beautiful cities of Europe and, uniquely, has remained largely unscathed by war for over three hundred years. Its fame rests upon a magnificent range of Baroque churches, palaces and public buildings embellished with art and sculpture from the eighteenth century. However, often overlooked, Prague also houses extraordinary examples of cultural works from a variety of other centuries, in particular the medieval period of the early fourteenth century and, at the other end of the time spectrum, the Art Nouveau movement.

The lectures will highlight major developments in Prague‚Äôs history from its origins in the ninth century up to today, while considering representative examples of works from successive artistic periods. Throughout the lectures, relevant excerpts of Prague‚Äôs musical tradition ‚Äì from religious chants and Hussite hymns to the compositions of the two towering figures of twentieth century Czech music, Smetana and Dvorak ‚Äì will be introduced.

The Citadel of Modlin Fortress, nowadays known as Garnizon Modlin (The Modlin Garrison) is unique on a global scale - the longest building in Europe and the second largest in the world. The spectacular fortress is located in the very heart of Poland, at the confluence of three rivers: the Vistula, the Narew and the Bug, in the immediate vicinity of picturesque sandy beaches hidden among forests and the phenomenal ruins of a historic granary. The Modlin Fortress is also over 200 years of turbulent history. The Poles, the French, Russians and Germans fought for this pearl of Napoleon and Tsar Nicholas I. After years of peace, in June 2018 Citadel will survive another siege, this time by the fans of electrifying sounds during the forthcoming INSTYTUT Festival :)

For whatever reason, Google Play Music doesn't update album art in the way that other music players do. Downloading a album art grabber and download your album cover art doesn't seem to do the trick. But with this method, it will refresh the Google Play Music database so your artwork shows up.

W7bfwdzv9BA,Bruce Conner - MONGOLOID - Art + Music - MOCAtv,"It may have been an unusual sight‚Äîan elder statesmen from the Beat Generation hanging out at Mabuhay Gardens at the height of punk, taking pictures of bands like Negative Trend and slam dancing with teenagers. But Bruce Conner was restless and the energy of punk invigorated him. For MONGOLOID (1978), the short film Conner began preparing after seeing Devo on their first tour, Conner spliced together newsreel, educational, and b-movie footage which resonated with their satirical lyrics about an underdeveloped man-child determined to fit into and positively contribute to mainstream American society. Gerald Casale discusses meeting Conner in Los Angeles and finding political and aesthetic common ground with Dada and Constructivism.

dSMiYzBEPY8,Psychosocial programs like art therapy and music therapy help heal kids faster,"Childhood cancer is a family disease in that it affects the life of patients and their parents and siblings. Cancer can also significantly impact a child's psychosocial state - their emotions, behaviors, thoughts. A child's psychosocial state also impacts his or her relationships with family, friends, peers, etc. 

Art therapy and music therapy are just two of the many programs our staff offers to patients with cancer. These programs help patients express their emotions in a healthy, effective way. They also serve as a distraction when things get especially difficult during treatment or in the hospital.

Our therapists are nationally certified and offer the best possible care to our patients and often times engage the entire family in sessions.

eEVOAhCEL5c,Art of Rene Magritte- Psychological surrealism (music-ENIGMA),"Ren√© Fran√ßois Ghislain Magritte (November 21, 1898 -- August 15, 1967) was a Belgian surrealist artist.

Magritte was born in Lessines, Belgium in 1898, the eldest son of L√©opold Magritte, a tailor, and Adeline, a milliner. He began drawing lessons in 1910. In 1912, his mother committed suicide by drowning herself in the River Sambre. Magritte was present when her body was retrieved from the water. The image of his mother floating, her dress obscuring her face, may have influenced a 1927-1928 series of paintings of people with cloth obscuring their faces, including Les Amant, but Magritte disliked this explanation. He studied at the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels for two years until 1918. In 1922 he married Georgette Berger, whom he had met in 1913.
Magritte worked in a wallpaper factory, and was a poster and advertisement designer until 1926 when a contract with Galerie la Centaure in Brussels made it possible for him to paint full-time. In 1926, Magritte produced his first surreal painting, The Lost Jockey (Le jockey perdu), and held his first exhibition in Brussels in 1927. Critics heaped abuse on the exhibition. Depressed by the failure, he moved to Paris where he became friends with Andr√© Breton, and became involved in the surrealist group.

When Galerie la Centaure closed and the contract income ended, he returned to Brussels and worked in advertising. Then, with his brother, he formed an agency, which earned him a living wage.

During the German occupation of Belgium in World War II he remained in Brussels, which led to a break with Breton. At the time he renounced the violence and pessimism of his earlier work, though he returned to the themes later.

His work showed in the United States in New York in 1936 and again in that city in two retrospective exhibitions, one at the Museum of Modern Art in 1965, and the other at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1992.

Magritte died of pancreatic cancer on August 15, 1967 and was interred in Schaarbeek Cemetery, Brussels.

Popular interest in Magritte's work rose considerably in the 1960s, and his imagery has influenced Pop, Minimalist, and Conceptual art.In 2005 he came 9th in the Walloon version of De Grootste Belg (The Greatest Belgian); in the Flemish version he was 18th.

A consummate technician, his work frequently displays a juxtaposition of ordinary objects in an unusual context, giving new meanings to familiar things. The representational use of objects as other than what they seem is typified in his painting, The Treachery of Images (La trahison des images), which shows a pipe that looks as though it is a model for a tobacco store advertisement. Magritte painted below the pipe, This is not a pipe (Ceci n'est pas une pipe), which seems a contradiction, but is actually true: the painting is not a pipe, it is an image of a pipe. (In his book, This Is Not a Pipe, French critic Michel Foucault discusses the painting and its paradox.)

Magritte pulled the same stunt in a painting of an apple: he painted the fruit realistically and then used an internal caption or framing device to deny that the item was an apple. In these Ceci n'est pas works, Magritte points out that no matter how closely, through realism-art, we come to depicting an item accurately, we never do catch the item itself: we cannot smoke tobacco with a picture of a pipe.

His art shows a more representational style of surrealism compared to the ""automatic"" style seen in works by artists like Joan Mir√≥. In addition to fantastic elements, his work is often witty and amusing. He also created a number of surrealist versions of other famous paintings.

Ren√© Magritte described his paintings by saying, ""My painting is visible images which conceal nothing; they evoke mystery and, indeed, when one sees one of my pictures, one asks oneself this simple question, 'What does that mean?'. It does not mean anything, because mystery means nothing either, it is unknowable. """,Art and Music

Lyrics:

I am just a poor boy.
Though my story's seldom told,
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles,
Such are promises
All lies and jest
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest.

When I left my home
And my family,
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station,
Running scared,
Laying low,
Seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go,
Looking for the places
Only they would know.",Art and Music

Capoeira is a Brazilian martial art that combines elements of dance and music. It was created in Brazil mainly by descendants of African slaves with Brazilian native influences, probably beginning in the 16th century. It is known by quick and complex moves, using mainly power, speed, and leverage for leg sweeps.
The word capoeira probably comes from Tupi, referring to the areas of low vegetation in the Brazilian interior.

I take a look at the history and origin of the internet music and art style that has become a meme. Macintosh plus album art has become iconic for the genre.

Vaporwave and aesthetic stylized as a e s t h e t i c is a popular genre of music and art style here on the internet, they have merged to become one popular sub genre that people enjoy. They have influenced other areas of the internet due to their popularity. Recently people have been wondering what the genre is all about so I attempt to explain and define the elements that make up the sometimes confusing music and art.

For whatever reason, Google Play Music doesn't update album art in the way that other music players do. Downloading a album art grabber and download your album cover art doesn't seem to do the trick. But with this method, it will refresh the Google Play Music database so your artwork shows up.

9KzoHl0QqdQ,Ancient Slavic Mythology ‚ú™ Pagan Art and Symbols ‚ú™ Epic Metal Music,"Slavic mythology is the mythological aspect of the polytheistic religion that was practised by the Slavs before Christianisation.

The religion possesses many common traits with other religions descended from the Proto-Indo-European religion.

Unlike Greek or Egyptian mythology, there are no first-hand records for the study of Slavic mythology. Despite some arguable theories (for instance, the Book of Veles), it cannot be proven that the Slavs had any sort of writing system before Christianisation; therefore, all their original religious beliefs and traditions were likely passed down orally over the generations, and basically forgotten over the centuries following the arrival of Christianity. Before that, sparse records of Slavic religion were mostly written by non-Slavic Christian missionaries who were uninterested in accurately portraying pagan beliefs. Archaeological remains of old Slavic Cult images and shrines have been found, though little can be yielded from them without legitimate knowledge of their contexts, other than confirming existing historical records. Fragments of old mythological beliefs and pagan festivals survive up to this day in folk customs, songs, and stories of all the Slavic nations.

Folk celebrations of various Christian festivals and popular beliefs in various saints. It is, for instance, quite clear that a popular saint in many Slavic countries, St Elijah the Thunderer, is a replacement of old thunder-god Perun. Likewise, traces of ancient deities can also be found in cults of many other saints, such as St Mary, St Vitus, St George, St Blaise and St Nicholas, and it is also obvious that various folk celebrations, such as the spring feast of Jare or Jurjevo and the summer feast of Ivanje or Ivan Kupala, both very loosely associated with Christian holidays, are abundant with pre-Christian elements. These beliefs have considerable religious and sacral significance to the people still performing them. The problem is, of course, that the elements of pre-Christian religion are hopelessly mixed into popular Christianity.

There was a large spring festival dedicated to Jarilo, god of vegetation and fertility. Processions of young men or girls used to go round villages on this day, carrying green branches or flowers as symbols of new life. They would travel from home to home, reciting certain songs and bless each household with traditional fertility rites. The leader of the procession, usually riding on a horse, would be identified with Jarilo. The custom of creating pisanki or decorated eggs, also symbols of new life, was another tradition associated with this feast, which was later passed on to Christian Easter.

For the last few decades, Slavic paganism has gained limited popularity among the Russian public, with many web sites and organizations dedicated to the study of Slavic mythology[1][2] and some who openly call for ""returning to the roots.""[3]

Some musicians are also influenced by paganism, such as pagan metal band Arkona.

Most of the neopagan movements take place in Russia and Belarus, but they also take place in other Slavic countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Slovakia, Poland, Croatia and Ukraine.",Art and Music

5CHtEASlzG8,Bruce Conner - BREAKAWAY - Art + Music - MOCAtv,"Dennis Hopper has described the experience of seeing Bruce Conner's A MOVIE (1958) like lifting the veil from his eyes, an associative blur of images that would go on to influence the infamous acid trip scene in his film Easy Rider. Years later, Hopper recalls, he and Dean Stockwell held the lights for Conner as he filmed Toni Basil dancing for BREAKAWAY (1966), the short film set to her song of the same name. A rare example of a Bruce Conner musical film containing all original photography, what makes the film unquestionably Conner is his frenetic editing and the evanescence of his subject, a spirit flickering in celluloid. The flashes of figure would reappear in Conner's sculptural photograms such as ""Sound of Two Hand Angel"" (1974).

VCj8jGkrupk,The Art of Punk - Black Flag Trailer - Art + Music - MOCAtv,"Created by writer/author of 'Fucked Up + Photocopied', Bryan Ray Turcotte (Kill Your Idols), and Bo Bushnell (The Western Empire), The Art Of Punk traces the roots of the punk movement and the artists behind the iconic logos of punk bands such as: Black Flag (Raymond Pettibon), The Dead Kennedys (Winston Smith), and Crass (Dave King). 

In addition to profiling the artists, the series includes intimate interviews with former band members, notable artists, and celebrities who have been heavily influenced by the art of punk rock including Jello Biafra, Tim Biskup, Scott Campbell, Chuck Dukowski, Flea, Steve Olson, Penny Rimbaud, Henry Rollins, Owen Thornton, and Gee Vaucher.

The filmmakers Bryan Ray Turcotte and Bo Bushnell take a unique approach to exploring the rich histories of these three seminal punk legends by focusing on the influential imagery and seeking out stories that have not been told yet through the artwork, which is integral to the importance and influence of each band. 

On June 11, 2013 The Art Of Punk debuts on MOCAtv with an episode on Raymond Pettibon and the artwork of Black Flag. The stories behind the art of Crass will debut on June 18, and June 25 will see the release of the Dead Kennedys episode, all of which will be available at: www.youtube.com/MOCAtv

eEVOAhCEL5c,Art of Rene Magritte- Psychological surrealism (music-ENIGMA),"Ren√© Fran√ßois Ghislain Magritte (November 21, 1898 -- August 15, 1967) was a Belgian surrealist artist.

Magritte was born in Lessines, Belgium in 1898, the eldest son of L√©opold Magritte, a tailor, and Adeline, a milliner. He began drawing lessons in 1910. In 1912, his mother committed suicide by drowning herself in the River Sambre. Magritte was present when her body was retrieved from the water. The image of his mother floating, her dress obscuring her face, may have influenced a 1927-1928 series of paintings of people with cloth obscuring their faces, including Les Amant, but Magritte disliked this explanation. He studied at the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels for two years until 1918. In 1922 he married Georgette Berger, whom he had met in 1913.
Magritte worked in a wallpaper factory, and was a poster and advertisement designer until 1926 when a contract with Galerie la Centaure in Brussels made it possible for him to paint full-time. In 1926, Magritte produced his first surreal painting, The Lost Jockey (Le jockey perdu), and held his first exhibition in Brussels in 1927. Critics heaped abuse on the exhibition. Depressed by the failure, he moved to Paris where he became friends with Andr√© Breton, and became involved in the surrealist group.

When Galerie la Centaure closed and the contract income ended, he returned to Brussels and worked in advertising. Then, with his brother, he formed an agency, which earned him a living wage.

During the German occupation of Belgium in World War II he remained in Brussels, which led to a break with Breton. At the time he renounced the violence and pessimism of his earlier work, though he returned to the themes later.

His work showed in the United States in New York in 1936 and again in that city in two retrospective exhibitions, one at the Museum of Modern Art in 1965, and the other at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1992.

Magritte died of pancreatic cancer on August 15, 1967 and was interred in Schaarbeek Cemetery, Brussels.

Popular interest in Magritte's work rose considerably in the 1960s, and his imagery has influenced Pop, Minimalist, and Conceptual art.In 2005 he came 9th in the Walloon version of De Grootste Belg (The Greatest Belgian); in the Flemish version he was 18th.

A consummate technician, his work frequently displays a juxtaposition of ordinary objects in an unusual context, giving new meanings to familiar things. The representational use of objects as other than what they seem is typified in his painting, The Treachery of Images (La trahison des images), which shows a pipe that looks as though it is a model for a tobacco store advertisement. Magritte painted below the pipe, This is not a pipe (Ceci n'est pas une pipe), which seems a contradiction, but is actually true: the painting is not a pipe, it is an image of a pipe. (In his book, This Is Not a Pipe, French critic Michel Foucault discusses the painting and its paradox.)

Magritte pulled the same stunt in a painting of an apple: he painted the fruit realistically and then used an internal caption or framing device to deny that the item was an apple. In these Ceci n'est pas works, Magritte points out that no matter how closely, through realism-art, we come to depicting an item accurately, we never do catch the item itself: we cannot smoke tobacco with a picture of a pipe.

His art shows a more representational style of surrealism compared to the ""automatic"" style seen in works by artists like Joan Mir√≥. In addition to fantastic elements, his work is often witty and amusing. He also created a number of surrealist versions of other famous paintings.

Ren√© Magritte described his paintings by saying, ""My painting is visible images which conceal nothing; they evoke mystery and, indeed, when one sees one of my pictures, one asks oneself this simple question, 'What does that mean?'. It does not mean anything, because mystery means nothing either, it is unknowable. """,Art and Music

RheSKxNyOL8,"Burning Man 2017: 70,000-strong expected to attend desert art and music festival - TomoNews","BLACK ROCK DESERT, NEVADA ‚Äî The Burning Man festival is here once again as hipsters from across the country start to litter the deserts of Nevada to play in the sand and use some dust. 

The no-holds-barred art and music festival parties on for nine straight days until September 4. About 70,000 people are expected to show up this year. 

Tickets are an ultra-affordable $1,200. Burning Manners also have to get to Black Rock Desert by themselves. 

Smoking Man is billed as a festival full of eclectic artists, off-the-wall families, high power CEO douches and tech dweebs. 

Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg have all partied it up at Hot Man before. Wouldn't you totally want to do some lines with these guys? 
The Smoldering Man was first held by Larry Harvey and some pals in 1986. 

It's called Burning Man because it started with some hippies chanting around a bonfire on the summer solstice on Baker Beach in San Fran. 

Since then, it's blown up into the spectacle you see now today. At the end of the festival, all the hipsters get together and burn a giant wooden man. It's so touching ‚Äî especially if you're as high as a Space-X rocket.

Lyrics:

I am just a poor boy.
Though my story's seldom told,
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles,
Such are promises
All lies and jest
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest.

When I left my home
And my family,
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station,
Running scared,
Laying low,
Seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go,
Looking for the places
Only they would know.",Art and Music
9KzoHl0QqdQ,Ancient Slavic Mythology ‚ú™ Pagan Art and Symbols ‚ú™ Epic Metal Music,"Slavic mythology is the mythological aspect of the polytheistic religion that was practised by the Slavs before Christianisation.

The religion possesses many common traits with other religions descended from the Proto-Indo-European religion.

Unlike Greek or Egyptian mythology, there are no first-hand records for the study of Slavic mythology. Despite some arguable theories (for instance, the Book of Veles), it cannot be proven that the Slavs had any sort of writing system before Christianisation; therefore, all their original religious beliefs and traditions were likely passed down orally over the generations, and basically forgotten over the centuries following the arrival of Christianity. Before that, sparse records of Slavic religion were mostly written by non-Slavic Christian missionaries who were uninterested in accurately portraying pagan beliefs. Archaeological remains of old Slavic Cult images and shrines have been found, though little can be yielded from them without legitimate knowledge of their contexts, other than confirming existing historical records. Fragments of old mythological beliefs and pagan festivals survive up to this day in folk customs, songs, and stories of all the Slavic nations.

Folk celebrations of various Christian festivals and popular beliefs in various saints. It is, for instance, quite clear that a popular saint in many Slavic countries, St Elijah the Thunderer, is a replacement of old thunder-god Perun. Likewise, traces of ancient deities can also be found in cults of many other saints, such as St Mary, St Vitus, St George, St Blaise and St Nicholas, and it is also obvious that various folk celebrations, such as the spring feast of Jare or Jurjevo and the summer feast of Ivanje or Ivan Kupala, both very loosely associated with Christian holidays, are abundant with pre-Christian elements. These beliefs have considerable religious and sacral significance to the people still performing them. The problem is, of course, that the elements of pre-Christian religion are hopelessly mixed into popular Christianity.

There was a large spring festival dedicated to Jarilo, god of vegetation and fertility. Processions of young men or girls used to go round villages on this day, carrying green branches or flowers as symbols of new life. They would travel from home to home, reciting certain songs and bless each household with traditional fertility rites. The leader of the procession, usually riding on a horse, would be identified with Jarilo. The custom of creating pisanki or decorated eggs, also symbols of new life, was another tradition associated with this feast, which was later passed on to Christian Easter.

For the last few decades, Slavic paganism has gained limited popularity among the Russian public, with many web sites and organizations dedicated to the study of Slavic mythology[1][2] and some who openly call for ""returning to the roots.""[3]

Some musicians are also influenced by paganism, such as pagan metal band Arkona.

Most of the neopagan movements take place in Russia and Belarus, but they also take place in other Slavic countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Slovakia, Poland, Croatia and Ukraine.",Art and Music

Artist's Statement

Just as the planets turn in rhythm, art is the expression of life. Art is powerful and fills our lives with beauty and expression. Art is my calling! I focus on the power of color and form relationships in my work. I like my images to feel spiritual, bold and alive, and I do this through the expression of feeling colors that create exciting and vibrant statements. I love to create deep emotion, feeling and atmosphere in all my paintings. Thank you for your interest in my work!


Biography

Cortez  was born in Roswell, New Mexico.

His work is mostly representative of abstract, impressionistic form in terms of color, rendering and composition.

Lyrics: 
Peace up, A-Town down
I'm in the club with my homies, tryna get a lil' v-I,
Keep it down on the low key, cause you know how it feels.
I said shawty she was checkin' up on me,
From the game she was spittin' my ear you'd think that she knew me.
So we decided to chill

Yeah (yeah) shawty got down an' said come and get me
Yeah (yeah) I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah (yeah) Her and my girl would be the best of homies
Yeah (yeah) next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming""",Art and Music

Lyrics:

Everyday is like a blank canvas
You know you can paint it anyway you want it
You can draw black clouds, you can make the sun shine
Color in a rainbow, or use black and white

Open up your eyes and your imagination

Come on let's write a song, a little poetry
Take a photograph, let's make some memories
You can make it anything that you want it to be
If you follow your heart, life is a work of art

Every night's like looking at a dark screen
You're never too young or too old to dream
You can make your fantasy into a reality
Cause you're creating your own masterpiece

Close your eyes and dream it, seeing is believing

Come on let's write a song, a little poetry
Take a photograph, let's make some memories
You can make it anything that you want it to be
If you follow your heart, life is a work of art

Let's write a song, a little poetry
Take a photograph, let's make some memories
You can make it anything that you want it to be
If you follow your heart, life is a work of art

Trying to simplify into philosophy
Turn the star into a galaxy
Make a little noise into a symphony
You're creating a masterpiece

Come on let's write a song, a little poetry
Take a photograph, let's make some memories
You can make it anything that you want it to be
If you follow your heart, life is a work of art

Come on let's write a song, a little poetry
Take a photograph, let's make some memories
You can make it anything that you want it to be
If you follow your heart, life is a work of art

Come on let's write a song, a little poetry
Take a photograph, let's make some memories
You can make it anything that you want it to be
If you follow your heart, life is a work of art

Life is a work of art

Lyrics:

And another one bites the dust
Oh why can I not conquer love?
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons

Well, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart,
But your blade - it mightbe too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard,
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart

H_a46WJ1viA,Simon and Garfunkel - Bridge Over Troubled Water,"Studio Version

Lyrics:

When you're weary
Feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I will dry them all

I'm on your side
When times get rough
And friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you

I'll take your part
When darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

Sail on Silver Girl,
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
If you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind",Art and Music

Vp8UKU44A6c,Squishy Makeover: Fixing Your Squishies #12,"Hey guys! Here's the long awaited 12th episode of squishy makeovers. Just a good ole fashioned one, no gimmicks! I'm sorry I am late for posting this, it has really beeen a long process making this video. Also, I have been a tad sick (if you can't tell from the constant coughing lol). Enjoy!

Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!

_________FAQs__________

1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?
So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already 

2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?
No. Everyone gave me these squishies as donations to the series because they were no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be completely impossible for me financially to send back squishies. Just to RECEIVE these squishies costs me hundreds of dollars (I have to pay for P.O. box fees) There are MANY other reasons as well, I explained it in this video if you want to know the full list of reasons: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKYCV...

3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?
I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip and Scribbles. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.

4. IS PUFFY PAINT THE SAME AS FABRIC PAINT?
Yep!! Puffy paint is just a type of fabric paint.

5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?
The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.

6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?
I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off. 

7. WHAT MEMORY FOAM DO YOU USE?
I usually just buy a memory foam pillow on Amazon.com and use that to cut up.

8. CAN YOU DO MORE SQUISHIES IN EACH VIDEO OR DO MAKEOVER VIDEOS EVERY WEEK?
I wish I could! But these videos take me about 30-50 hours to film and edit (not including waiting for the paint to dry or any breaks). And usually about 8 or 9 days of working on it. So it‚Äôs not really possible to do these any more than I am already doing without lowering the quality. PLUS! I want to keep up with my Monday videos and my art and craft videos as well ‚ò∫

9. WHY DO YOU SOMETIMES USE A POPSICLE STICK AND OTHER TIMES USE A PAINTBRUSH TO APPLY PAINT?
The ‚Äúslick‚Äù fabric paint has a very thick consistency that does not spread easily with a paint brush. Using a popsicle stick is much easier for this type of paint. BUT the ""matte"" fabric paint is much thinner, similar consistency to acrylic paint and it can easily be applied with a paintbrush. When you mix the two, you can get away with a paintbrush as well :)

10. WHY DO YOU LIKE RAINBOW SO MUCH?
I just like color, and I think rainbows are pretty. There‚Äôs really no other reason for my obsession haha

I Fall Apart ‚Äì Post Malone Lyrics:

[Intro]
Oooh, I fall apart
Oooh, yeah, mmhmm

[Verse 1]
She told me that I'm not enough, yeah
And she left me with a broken heart, yeah
She fooled me twice and it's all my fault, yeah
She cut too deep, now she left me scarred, yeah
Now there's too many thoughts goin' through my brain, yeah
And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine, yeah

[Chorus]
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

[Verse 2]
Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go
Everybody told me, so
Feelin' like I sold my soul
Devil in the form of a wh*re
Devil in the form of a wh*re
You said it
No, you said it
No, you said it
We'd be together

[Chorus]
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

[Bridge]
Ice keep pourin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
Covered in scars and I can't help showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep blowin'
Ice keep droppin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
All these scars, can't help from showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep blowin', yeah

[Chorus]
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

Lyrics:
Days like this I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drain me down
That was then and this is now
Now look at me

Chorus:
This is the part of me
That you‚Äôre never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you‚Äôre never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you‚Äôre not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you‚Äôre never gonna ever take away from me, no

I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

Chorus:
This is the part of me
That you‚Äôre never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you‚Äôre never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you‚Äôre not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you‚Äôre never gonna ever take away from me, no

Bridge:
Now look at me I‚Äôm sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You won‚Äôt never put me out again
I‚Äôm glowing oh whoa
So you can keep the diamond ring
It don‚Äôt mean nothing anyway
In fact you can keep everything
Yeah yeah, except for me

Chorus:
This is the part of me
That you‚Äôre never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you‚Äôre never gonna ever take away from me, no (away from me)
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you‚Äôre not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you‚Äôre never gonna ever take away from me, no

This is the part of me (no)
(away from me) This is the part of me
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you‚Äôre not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you‚Äôre never gonna ever take away from me, no

As a musician, I decided to put the text to easy music.  Here I am presenting a video that includes the book art, the text, and my music.

Lyrics:

Churaya hi kyu jab vo todna hi tha
Dil bi vo tuta hai jo mere paas nahi

Dikhaya hi kyu jab muh modna hi tha 
Seene mai hawa toh hai par vo saans nahi

Mere paas nahi hai koi saath nahi hai
Jo btade mujhe baat ye khaas nahi 

Dil udaas sahi hai koi aas nahi hai
Pagli ankhon ki nami hai ye barsaat nahi

*Drop*

Main bhi na jaane kaha kho gaya tha
Zindagi bhi mujhse khafa ho gayi

Jis din ki is dil ne khudse mohobat
To zindagi bhi mujhpe fida ho gayi

Mere paas nahi hai koi saath nahi hai
Or na hai ab kisika intezaar kahi

Tere baare mai na sochu aisi raat nahi hai
Par tu tode dil mera teri aukaat nahi

*Drop*

Ankhon mai dhuan tha maine dekha hi nahi
Khushi peeche hi thi khadi daabe ye hassi

Dil bhi bola sunn baaware ankhiyon ke dushman
Naa mai kabhi tuta tha na khoya tha kabhi

Tere paas yahi hu ye awaaz mai hi hu
Ye kahani teri meri hai zamane ki nahi

Mai dhadakta rahu tu bhi yu hast rahe
Duniya jaye saali bhaad mai koi parwa hi nahi

*Drop*

Ek raat jaaga main maine dekha tha saweraa",Art and Music

Lyrics:

A man walks down the street
He says why am I soft in the middle now
Why am I soft in the middle
The rest of my life is so hard
I need a photo-opportunity
I want a shot at redemption
Don't want to end up a cartoon
In a cartoon graveyard
Bonedigger Bonedigger
Dogs in the moonlight
Far away my well-lit door
Mr. Beerbelly Beerbelly
Get these mutts away from me
You know I don't find this stuff amusing anymore

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty when you call me
You can call me Al

I wasn't born last night
I know these hoes ain't right
But you was blowing up her phone last night
But she ain't have her ringer nor her ring on last night, oh
Nigga, that's that nerve
Why give a bitch your heart
When she rather have a purse?
Why give a bitch your inch
When she rather have nine?
You know how the game goes
She be mine by half time, I'm the shit, oh
Nigga, that's that nerve
You all about her, and she all about hers
Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos
And I done did everything but trust these hoes
(CB fuck with me!)

When a rich nigga want you
And yournigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see""",Art and Music

ebILIKHi9wo,Delta Heavy - White Flag (Official Video),"After the widespread success of their recent ‚ÄòParadise Lost‚Äò album, Delta Heavy‚Äôs untouchable work ethic has assured this momentum is continuing. Capitalising on millions of streams worldwide across multiple platforms, their next release sees them delving into a cross-pollination of genres which yet again solidifies their position as producers who can tap into a vast, versatile soundscape.

Lead single ‚ÄòWhite Flag‚Äô nods to not only their flawless ingenuity, but also their ability to switch up different bpms. This is something they‚Äôre renowned for in the US; the technical ability to travel through genres translates just as well into their production as it has done in their DJ sets. Orchestrated meticulously, ‚ÄòWhite Flag‚Äô juxtaposes a euphoric, incessantly infectious vocal topline with Delta Heavy‚Äôs signature thumping halftime beats, a searing bassline and surging chords. Sounding totally original, the single blends DnB with glittering Electronica resulting in the perfect follow up to ‚ÄòGhost‚Äô, equally at home on daytime radio as well as late night DJ sets.

fZaqyfGuRr8,Sui Dhaaga: Made in India,"""Sui Dhaaga - Made in India"" is a heart-warming story of pride and self-reliance, which finds its roots in the heart of India and reflects the passion that runs through the veins of every single Indian. Taking the message of ""Made in India"" forward, the film modestly tries to bring back our traditional art forms and handicrafts in focus. Through Mauji (Varun Dhawan) & his wife Mamta (Anushka Sharma), the film talks about the need of social entrepreneurship as a tool for social and economic development of our artisans, living their life in the margins due to the changing times. Set in a small town in India, the film encapsulates the journey of an honest man from a humble background, who pursues his passion, overcoming all odds and soon finds himself on the cover of an international magazine with the world taking note and appreciating his talent. A clean family entertainer, the film emphasizes virtues like honesty, self-respect and community living.",Art and Music
