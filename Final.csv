Transcript: Michael Montoya: Hi Bill. Michael Montoya here. What do you think is the evolutionary advantage to humanity being both musically and artistically creative? And where do you think this initial spark of creativity came from?

Bill Nye: Michael. Michael. This is a great question and susceptible to speculation. Apparently music and art is part of the way we communicate and it's certainly the way you attract mates. I'll just put it to you that way. Musicians and artists engage other people in a way that people who don't use music and don't use art do not. Now, there's a lot of talk about songbirds in evolutionary biology and they all have these songs, which must be pleasing to the ears of their potential mates and also must send messages to others of their species, so I guess to other species as well. I am angry; this is my territory; I'm looking for a mate; it's a sunny day. These sort of announcements are made by other species so you figure humans have just taken it just a whole other level with albums and record release parties and art exhibits and art museums and art galleries. So it really is deep within us and I think art enriches our lives, engages our brains and stimulates us in a way that nothing else we do does. So, this is only speculation on my part but music especially certainly inspires us. That's for sure. So carry on Michael. Turn it up loud.",Art and Music

Original music for #GeekandSundry's #CriticalRole

SO this piece took research to pull off, I'd read that Matt had based a lot of Wildemount's culture off of real life Eastern European examples and I remember hearing a while back that his favourite instrument was violin so I implemented a mix of Eastern European folk music (Polish, Hungarian, etc.) into a very rhythmic orchestral. I'd started this piece a few days prior to the first episode so the fact that they're using music from the Witcher series actually coincides quite well with this. You may have noticed but I also worked Jason Charles Miller's original main theme into the ending and a violin passage mixed in with my own theme. 

I'll go into a more in depth analysis if enough people want to know how this was made.",Art and Music

Sleeping. That's what we're doing every day. Asleep, following the next big thing, mindlessly chasing after the same objectives that mean nothing after we've achieved them. 

Or is there something else... Something you know, deep inside your soul, that is the one thing you've suppressed for so long, because facing reality is too hard, and so you keep that thing hidden. 

There's nothing stopping you but the conformity of society.

You called him on the phone
When you‚Äôre all alone
I know what you do when you do it and where you did it, too

I hope he‚Äôs there for you
I know you always knew
A heart like this doesn‚Äôt come around everyday

And I just can‚Äôt get this out of my head
Cuz to me you were already dead

So now you know
We‚Äôre bought and sold
It never really mattered that much to me
I was just awake

And I just can‚Äôt get this out of my head
Cuz to me you were already dead

But my eyes now see through
What I need to do
I‚Äôd like to leave it all in the past and I swear that I‚Äôll never look back

And I just can‚Äôt get you out of my head
Cuz to me you were already dead

Kasey Jones is a driven, diverse and forward-thinking artist with a truly unique creative approach.  He is passionate about making intimate and poignant songs, often aided by simple production tools in the comfort of his own living room.
Inspired by the intimacy of folk and the grit of indie rock, Kasey‚Äôs work tips the hat off to artists as diverse as the Beatles, Elliott Smith or Wilco, making for a remarkably eclectic approach. Recently, he set out to complete the works on his new album, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs The Point‚Äù, a completely independent release, which was produced, recorded and engineered by Kasey Jones himself at his home studio. The artist even performed every instrument on this release, highlighting his versatility and broad musical scope.

One of the most exciting things about Art and Music is that Jones can exercise full creative control over every stage of the music-making experience, from conception to fruition!

His songs are filled with relatable lyrics and stunning melodies, which are catchy, yet richly nuanced and very direct.

Staring straight down at the sink
I don‚Äôt even need to think
I‚Äôll pass the time with my dog Pitch 
Reminisce about a life we lived

Cuz I can fly a million miles away
I‚Äôd still be at the same old place
I don‚Äôt need a clock to pass the time 
It‚Äôs written on my face and it‚Äôs in the line

Sudden thoughts are such a shame 
Left alone they‚Äôll just turn to gray 
A chance that you might never take 
Sinks your soul and it stamps a date

Maybe you can reach me now and again 
But I don‚Äôt think that time is a friend 
AnymoreAnymore

It‚Äôs time I get a P.O. Box 
Collect the mail that I never got 
Buy a ship and sail far away 
to the life that got away

Cuz I can fly a million miles away 
I‚Äôd still be at the same old place
I don‚Äôt need a clock to pass the time 
It‚Äôs written in my face and it‚Äôs in the lie

The title song 'Might Just Die' is singing a parting of a couple behind the grand string sounds. Dramatic lyrics covering from love, sorrow, anger to regret are very impressive and the special arrangement element is hidden at the end of the song for the stage performance of HISTORY. 

At the 4th mini album [Beyond the HISTORY] you can meet attractive vocal, rap and performance of the five members at the same time as well as the totally 'NEW HISTORY' you've never seen before.

a mini-series on the missing millennium of  Ancient past, First thing is to get the story on the conflict, (because there is always a conflict in everything) with what year it is really, it seems some Benedictine Monks were monkeying with the chronological timeline.Also, that the reformation and inquisition were hidden behind religious reasons but were really carried out to suppress knowledge & events and get rid of all of the books & writings contrary to their dogmatic belief system of control they were usurping the powers that be and implementing themselves in control of the people.Part 2 will deal with the book of Veles and the scattered ones of Atlantis. Why Monks and not historians were in charge of this I can only guess. So it is possible this year may really be 1017? Hmm, Fair use, full credit to sources shown below.

Also, the young lady in the NewEarth video is named Silvie, I said Silvia many apologies, I know it isn't going to matter this only applies to the haters but, it really serves no purpose to hurl insults that didn't come until this video got 20k views so I wonder where that would come from & why?

gvHMiduRS-g,10 Foods You Should and Shouldn&#39;t Wash Before Cooking,"Since childhood, we‚Äôve been taught to always wash everything we‚Äôre about to eat to make it safe for our health. However, very few people know that sometimes this habit does more harm than good. Washing certain foods can spread dangerous bacteria that make their way into your body and wreak havoc on your well-being. 
You don‚Äôt need to wash store-bought eggs since they‚Äôve already been washed during commercial processing. Plus, manufacturers often put special substances on eggs to protect them from bacterial contamination.
When you wash chicken or meat, the water helps the bacteria spread to your hands and the kitchen sink. Washing mushrooms isn‚Äôt a good idea because the more water mushrooms absorb, the weaker their flavor is. You should also never soak, remove the stalk, or peel them.
You absolutely have to wash fruits and vegetables with both edible and inedible skin. Don't soak fruits and vegetables in water, either. This won't clean them but only spread the bacteria. Use running water, it's a safer bet. Just dry the food with a paper towel or a napkin after the ‚Äúcold shower‚Äù.
Food will definitely get contaminated if you don't wash the can really well before you open it. You should also always wash fresh nuts before eating them, even if they‚Äôre peeled.

Music: Seven ‚Äì Twenty 
https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music

TIMESTAMPS
Never wash these foods:
Eggs 0:29
Chicken 1:10
Meat 2:08
Pasta 3:11
Mushrooms 3:55
Always wash these foods:
Fruits and vegetables with edible skin 4:30
Fruits and vegetables with inedible skin 5:12
Cans 5:58
Nuts 6:34
Dried fruit 7:21

SUMMARY
-Don't wash store-bought eggs. You will remove the protective layer so if the shell gets cracked, chances are the egg will become infected.
-When you wash chicken, the water helps the bacteria spread to your hands and the kitchen sink.
-Just like chicken, you shouldn't wash raw meat, like beef, pork, veal, or lamb, because it‚Äôs also covered in bacteria that the water just spreads all around.
-Washing pasta is pretty much criminal in the culinary world because the water removes the starch that helps the noodles absorb sauce more effectively.
-Washing mushrooms isn‚Äôt a good idea because the more water mushrooms absorb, the weaker their flavor is.
-Rinse fruits and vegetables with edible skin under regular cold running water to remove 99% of the dangerous bacteria. Dry the food with a paper towel or a napkin after the ‚Äúcold shower‚Äù.
-Even if you aren't planning on eating the rind of a lemon or orange, you still need to wash these fruits and also scrub the outside with a clean brush.
-Wash your tin cans with soap before you ever open them to prevent their contents from getting contaminated. 
-Washing nuts helps get rid of the phytic acid they contain. Plus, you never know for sure where they‚Äôve been stored, how they were transported, and how many people touched them at the grocery store.
-Even if you bought dried fruit in a nice pretty package, you have to wash it first or soak it for a few hours.

10 FOODS YOU SHOULD NEVER EAT",Food
DzuOaJ9f8qI,10 Foods You Should Never Eat,"We know some products are really dangerous for our health, and other products are good for us as they are healthy. It turns out it‚Äôs not so simple and some of the most promoted and popular foods can, in fact, harm you. Never eat these 10 dangerous foods for the sake of your own health and the health of your family. 
Even if you see the juice labels ‚Äúnot from concentrate‚Äù or ‚Äú100% pure‚Äù, don't let this fool you. Juice, after being squeezed from different fruits, is kept in huge vacuum-sealed tanks where it can sit for up to a year before being packaged! And by that time, the juice has lost all its flavor, which is why manufacturers have to add artificial flavoring to make it taste fruity again.
In most cases, cereals are loaded with refined carbohydrates and sugar. Even if the label assures you that it's fat-free and whole grain, check the list of ingredients. You'll most likely see that the product is full of sugar.
Despite common belief, most yogurts don't contain probiotic bacteria since the process of pasteurization kills all these microorganisms. 
When consumed, trans-fats in ice-cream can cause high cholesterol, stroke, heart disease, and even cancer. Ice cream is also loaded with sugar, artificial flavors, and synthetic preservatives. And if it‚Äôs pink, purple, or red, it‚Äôs most likely been colored with cochineal extract or carmine, additives which can cause bad allergic reactions. 
Popcorn has some genetically modified ingredients as well as taste-boosting chemicals and additives. This leads to health problems such as heart attacks, digestive issues, allergies, skin rashes, breathing problems, and the depressing list goes on. Even more, popcorn is extremely caloric.

Fruit juices 0:37

Cereal 2:31

Eggs 6:07
Microwave popcorn 7:09
Sugar-free candy 8:32

SUMMARY
-Store-bought juices may contain some real fruit, but most of their content is water, sugar, and artificial flavoring.
-Protein bars and energy bars alike are usually processed products containing sugar, artificial flavors and sweeteners.
-Breakfast cereals typically contain a teeny tiny amount of whole grains, which allows producers to mark their product as healthy, but they also contain unhealthy sugar. 
-Margarine is typically made from industrial vegetable oils hydrogenated to become solid, a process that significantly increases the oils‚Äô trans-fat content.
-Manufacturers load ‚Äúlow-fat‚Äù yogurts with sugar to make up for the lack of taste usually provided by the natural fats.
-Instead of pure milk or cream, manufacturers use cheaper hydrogenated fats such as palm- or coconut oil to produce ice-cream. These oils, when heated, become nothing more than trans-fats.
-One egg contains as much cholesterol as a big greasy burger.
-Microwave popcorn‚Äôs almost always lined with the same toxic substance you can find in Teflon pans.
-If candy doesn‚Äôt contain sugar, it contains artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose, and saccharine. These substances are chemically processed and may cause some serious side effects.
-Artificial sweeteners in diet soda can easily lead to weight gain as they trigger the production of insulin, which makes your body store fat.

DzuOaJ9f8qI,10 Foods You Should Never Eat,"We know some products are really dangerous for our health, and other products are good for us as they are healthy. It turns out it‚Äôs not so simple and some of the most promoted and popular foods can, in fact, harm you. Never eat these 10 dangerous foods for the sake of your own health and the health of your family. 
Even if you see the juice labels ‚Äúnot from concentrate‚Äù or ‚Äú100% pure‚Äù, don't let this fool you. Juice, after being squeezed from different fruits, is kept in huge vacuum-sealed tanks where it can sit for up to a year before being packaged! And by that time, the juice has lost all its flavor, which is why manufacturers have to add artificial flavoring to make it taste fruity again.
In most cases, cereals are loaded with refined carbohydrates and sugar. Even if the label assures you that it's fat-free and whole grain, check the list of ingredients. You'll most likely see that the product is full of sugar.

Description:
It has been said that those that do not learn about history are doomed to repeat it. A lot of students may find history boring and would rather focus on the here and now, but sometimes history can be surprising. Bizarre facts and events that we may not have learned about from our high school textbooks. Try as we may, not all information can be stored in a single textbook and history is not an exact science. Sometimes the things that are left out are believed to be ‚Äòtoo sensitive‚Äô or ‚Äòvulgar‚Äô for young people to hear about and needed to be censored. Other times it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not deemed important enough or for convenience sake for different cultures. But these are some of those intriguing events and people that helped shaped the world as we know it today, whether we learned about them in school or not.
While many of us would prefer to look to the future, history is a part of everyone‚Äôs lives. But sometimes what we were taught in school was only the tip of the historical iceberg. Here are 10 historical facts they never taught you in school.

CWGb3tsccQ4,11 Reasons to Visit Bangkok Thailand,"I just came back from Bangkok, and wanted to share 11 reasons that you should consider going to Bangkok in Thailand!  From the food, amazing hotels, friendliness of the Thai people, the culture, the history, there are tons of reasons to visit Bangkok!  EXPAND DESCRIPTION FOR MORE!

1. Food

-  Thai food is popular around the world, but come here to eat REAL Thai food
Curries, Noodles, but try something new like Durian, and oh so much more!
Huge river prawns
Thai Iced Thai
Coconut everything, drinks, ice cream
Mango Everything, Mango Sticky Rice, Mango Drinks, etc.
Yes, the Pad Thai is better here!
Tip Sammai pad thai
Oddly enough, McDonalds is everywhere in Bangkok

- Stayed away from food on the street, and stuck to food courts, stalls, places generally with running water

2. Cheap

- Thailand is famously cheap, and I didn‚Äôt really appreciate how cheap it was until we were actually there.
- Exchange rate is about 1 USD to 32 Thai Baht
You can get a plate of noodles, or a curry for 30 Baht no problem!
You can try a lot of different things, and since it‚Äôs only a buck, who cares if it isn‚Äôt good or you don‚Äôt eat it all?
Want a whole coconut to drink from?  40 Baht.  Might be $5-10 in the US for that coconut
We eat tons of Mango Sticky Rice since it was like $1 USD a portion
Most of our cheap meals for 2 people were on average about $5
- Taxi rides‚Ä¶ a 40 minute taxi ride cost 100 Baht, that‚Äôs 4 bucks!
Bottled water‚Ä¶. at the airport, 7 Baht, 30 cents!
Sky Train, starts at like 16 Baht‚Ä¶ 50 cents a ride
Ferry ride across the river, 4 Baht.

3. Luxury experiences

- High end dining, personal drivers, the kind of things you could never afford back home are reasonably priced in Bangkok

4. Temples

Old and New
The Royal Palace ‚Äî this is the one place that isn‚Äôt cheap!  It cost 500 Baht to enter. What???
But the Royal Palace was totally over the top! Gold, gold, and more gold!
Wat Arun (Temple of Dawn)
Wat Pho (Reclining Buddha)
By the way, I think all the Buddhas are reclining because it‚Äôs soooo hot!

5. Ayuthaya

- The former capital of Siam, a great day trip from Bangkok!

6. Legendary 5 star hotel service

Everybody says the 5 star hotels have amazing service, they do!
The JW Marriott Bangkok was amazing!

7. Cooking classes
One of the most popular things to do in Bangkok is to take a cooking class
Learn how to cook your favorite Thai dishes

8. Shopping

- Chatuchak Weekend Market is the largest outdoor market in Southeast Asia with 15,000 vendors
Asiatique is a great option if you can‚Äôt make it to Chatuchak, it‚Äôs a night market, and the best option is to get there by boat
Tons of upscale shopping near Siam station

9. Massage

It‚Äôs everywhere in Bangkok!  And it‚Äôs cheap!
You could even take a massage class and learn how to massage!

10. Thai people are super friendly!

Even the ones that try to scam you!

11. Because it‚Äôs Bangkok and it‚Äôs famous!  Everybody has some Bangkok story, you should have yours!

BcDFGR2hvNM,11 Things I Love About Traveling to Singapore,"Singapore is one of my favorite travel destinations in the world.  I share with you my top 11 reasons why I love traveling to Singapore.  The producer of Crazy Rich Asians said that movie was his ‚Äúlove letter‚Äù to Singapore -- which inspired me to make this video!
EXPAND DESCRIPTION FOR TABLE OF CONTESTS.

1 - The Food!  
Hawker Centres, Food Courts (for A/C), 
Clean, don‚Äôt have to worry about getting sick
Laksa, Noodles, Satay, Fruit Juices
Pack of tissue to ‚Äúchope‚Äù a seat

2 - It‚Äôs a great Mileage Run!
Regularly $600 round trip from LAX

3- Changi Airport
Butterflies, Koi Fish, Movie Theatre, 3-story slide, 24 hour food courts

4- Singapore Airlines
Satay in Flight -- their lounges are amazing!  Dim Sum!  Singapore Girl dress, since 1972

5- The Gardens
Gardens by the Bay, Cloud Forest Dome, Supertrees, Skywalk, Botanic Garden (1,200 species of orchids, 4.5 million visitors per year)

6- Hotels
Marriott on Orchard Road, Conrad in the CBD

7- Public Transit
MRT is well signposted, easy to navigate and air-conditioned (refuge from hot-steamy weather above), most attractions within walking distance of the MRT.  Polite Passengers, Cheap: 2 day pass is $16, and it‚Äôs on time.  Just don‚Äôt drink, eat, or bring on a durian!
Taxis are easy to get: 30,000 official taxis servicing a population of fewer than 5.5 million people
8- Urban Hiking
Singapore Southern Ridges Trail -- you‚Äôre never far from an MRT

9- Singapore Zoo
I think it‚Äôs the best in the world!  

10- Multiculture
combination of Asian and European cultures. Influenced by Malay, South Asian, East Asian, and Eurasian cultures, Singapore has been dubbed as a country where ""East meets West""

Singapore population is 74.2% Chinese, 13.3% Malay, 9.2% Indian and 3.3% other. It‚Äôs also the most religiously diverse nation in the world, its population made up of sizable portions of Buddhists, Christians, Muslims and Hindus.

In Singapore's hawker centres, for example, traditionally Malay hawker stalls selling also Tamil food. Chinese stalls may introduce Malay ingredients, cooking techniques or entire dishes into their range of catering.

More than seven in 10 Singaporeans believe personal success is independent of race or ethnicity

11 - Don‚Äôt need to pack any winter clothes
Nobody complains about being cold! (well as long as they are outside)

When you eliminate these foods you'll find your digestive system begins to work more efficiently. This means you'll be receiving more nutrition from your food. It's the lack of nutrition which often causes weight gain as the body can go into patterns of binge eating in an attempt to receive enough nutrition. All chronic diseases are directly related to nutrient deficiencies, so it's vital to ensure your digestive system is working at its best. https://young1.life/",Food

AYbJf_wJYcc,13 Travel Tips for INTROVERTS,"Introverts can enjoy travel too!  13 tips to help introverts make the most out of their trips and be comfortable!  I have a secret, and you probably won‚Äôt believe it based on what you perceive of me on Youtube, but I‚Äôm one of the biggest introverts you‚Äôll ever meet!  When I share this with people I‚Äôm told I ‚Äúhide it very well.‚Äù  I can be extremely ‚Äúoutgoing‚Äù in bursts, but I need time to recharge.  I don‚Äôt think you have to hide being an introvert.  Embrace it, and follow these tips to get more enjoyment out of your introvert travels!

1 - Travel Solo
 Some people just can‚Äôt conceive that this is possible, or that anyone would want to do this.  Or that it‚Äôs strange, or you‚Äôre weird.  Don‚Äôt listen to them.  Lots of people do it, and there‚Äôs nothing strange about it.

2 - Avoid group tours
 Try Audio Guides instead like Detour, or Rick Steves Europe Walks

3 - But sometimes you might want some group activity
 Maybe a couple hour walking tour
 Or ‚Äúactive‚Äù tours, like a cycling tour‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt talk too much there.
 Or an evening pub crawl
 They are bounded in time, and you can retreat to your ‚Äúme‚Äù space

5 - Stuck with a group?  Make sure you have some downtime scheduled in.
Be up front with them‚Ä¶ you need your me time. It‚Äôs ok.

6 - Traveling with an extrovert?  It‚Äôs OK to do separate things sometimes and then join up
 Be up front with them‚Ä¶ you need your me time. You‚Äôre not weird.

7 - Noise cancelling headphones are your friends

8 - Restaurants
Bring a book (your travel guide)
Eat early, they won‚Äôt mind if you‚Äôre taking up a whole table
Sit at the Counter
Go fast casual

9 - Avoid Hostels, Tread carefully with Bed and Breakfasts
 Hostels are party places, and not much alone space
 Research the B&B, make sure they don‚Äôt have group breakfasts, and the hosts aren‚Äôt too invasive or chatty
Call in advance and explain that you‚Äôre looking for a place where you can be alone

10 - Take a camera
 Gives you something to do‚Ä¶ you‚Äôve got a mission.  Make a youtube video!

11 - On a long road trip 
Listen to Audio Books

12 - Head in to Nature
take a hike‚Ä¶ not many people out there

13 - Know when you‚Äôre done
 Know when your social batteries are empty
It‚Äôs ok to pass on after dinner drinks, or even dinner itself.
I eat when I‚Äôm hungry, I drink when I‚Äôm thirsty, and I rest when I‚Äôm tired.  I don‚Äôt want to get sick.

fPxDjkqAE2I,15 FOODS THAT&#39;LL NEVER MAKE YOU FAT,"What can you eat without getting fat? Everyone‚Äôs cherished dream is to eat anything at any time and still not gain weight. Is this possible?! Actually, there are foods you can eat without limitations even if you‚Äôre crazy about keeping your figure. Sounds too good to be true! These foods are rich in fiber while being low calorie, satiating you without the risk of gaining weight. Lucky you ‚Äì today, we‚Äôve compiled a list of such foods! 

And forget the myth that you‚Äôll gain weight if you eat after 6pm. It‚Äôs completely wrong! In fact, if you want to stay slim, it‚Äôs best to have dinner 3-4 hours before bed. So if you go to bed at 11 p.m., you can calmly eat at 7 p.m. It won‚Äôt hurt your figure at all!

Popcorn 0:36

#weightloss #excessweight #perfectfit

SUMMARY:
- If you fry popcorn without butter and sugar (with a little salt, for instance), you can eat it without fear. This way, a portion (about a cup) only contains 31 kcal.
- Celery stems are 95% water. They help you lose excess weight and detoxify your body thanks to their diuretic effect. A medium-sized stalk of celery contains only 6 calories!
- A portion of eggplant grilled or baked without oil makes for 24 kcal, so you can enjoy this savory veggie without any limitations.
- A large amount of fruit is not recommended if you want to lose weight, yet citrus fruits are an exception here. They‚Äôre rich in substances like fiber, flavonoids, and vitamin C.
- Melon and watermelon are 95% water. With 60-70 kcal per slice, you can eat them day in and day out. These fruits help excrete excess liquid from your body and satiate you well.
- Algae, like laminaria, are the best source of iodine. They help your thyroid function normally, keeping your hormones at normal levels and preventing you from gaining weight.
- A portion of zucchini is about 42 kcal. It normalizes your salt-water ratio, improves your intestinal function, and can also be used to lower the energy output of main courses.
- A cucumber is 95% water; therefore, this vegetable can quench your thirst easily. And the remaining 5% is a source of vitamins and minerals.
- Beetroot is a source of nutrients, such as manganese. They help burn fat, drive your muscles, and regulate your blood sugar. An average portion is just 40 kcal!
- You can eat eggs at any time of the day, even at night, without fear of gaining weight. Of course, boiled eggs are better than fried ones. One boiled egg contains about 80 kcal!
- The bromelain contained within pineapples actively splits fats and helps metabolize proteins. A slice of pineapple is about 30 kcal.
- One apple is only 50 kcal. It makes you feel satiated and regulates your digestion. Plums are rich in vitamin C and potassium, which maintain your heart and vessels.
- Salad is a great source of folic acid, and you can eat it by the ton: one leaf of lettuce is 3 kcal!
- Currants and cranberries are rich in vitamin C, and the former is also a diuretic, helping get rid of excess water.
- A portion of diced cabbage is just 7 kcal. You shouldn‚Äôt, of course, only eat cabbage and cauliflower, as their nutrients rival with iodine, but you can easily include these foods a couple of times a week.

JSlluO_noAs,15 Worst Travel Pet Peeves,"Seeing the world is amazing, but sometimes the journey can be really annoying!  I share my list of the top 15 WORST things that annoy me about traveling.  These things really bug me!  EXPAND DESCRIPTION FOR TABLE OF CONTENTS.  I‚Äôll start by talking about pet peeves at airports, then annoyances from planes, hotels, transportation, and finally just out and about at a destination.  This idea came from Yellow Productions subscriber socalseth!  Thanks Seth for the idea, and some of the starter annoyances!

-- Airports --
1 - Security Check
= People trying to sneak things thru tsa
= Or the person that tries to go thru tsa with the Mr T starter set worth of jewelry
= Passengers who neglect to push their luggage through the TSA scanner
= TSA in general -- smile more dudes
= CBP at passport control -- I‚Äôm not a terrorist -- how about a welcome home?
= Security announcements about not leaving bags unattended -- I know already!
= When the Pre Check line is longer than the regular line
2 - Lines
= When the elite line is longer than the regular line
= People who pretend the line doesn‚Äôt apply to them
= Gate ‚Äúlice‚Äù -- Oh.. I‚Äôm not in boarding group 1?
= Standing right next to the baggage claim belt
3 - Check in
= Self check-in machines that don‚Äôt work
= Airlines that don‚Äôt open check-in until 2 hours before

4 - Airport shops
= $4 extortion priced water -- In japan they have water check machines
= Airport food
= Airline lounges that are ‚Äúfull‚Äù
5 - Delays
Flights that are delayed endlessly -- if my plane isn‚Äôt here and it‚Äôs departure time, maybe you should announce a delay

-- Planes --
6 - Odor
= too much perfume (Seth)
= body odor is terrible -- in general odor, and feet
= Bringing Smelly food on the plane
7 - Lack of etiquette
= Rudeness 
= parents that don't manage their kids well
= obviously had too much to drink
= Arm rest hog
= Full seat recline immediately without looking
= Dressing like nobody else is on the plane with you
8 - Boarding and deplaning
= Bringing too much stuff on the plane
= Not being ready
= Unpacking their whole suitcase on the plane
= Asking me to switch seats
= Exit row by row

-- Hotels --
9 - Front Desk
= The check-in line that never ends
= Check out is at 11am when you checked in at 1am
10 - Fees
= Resort fees
= Parking fees (If I pay, the valet should be FAST!)
= Wifi Fees (If I pay, the wifi should be BLAZING! And 2 devices???)
11 - Rooms
Noisy A/C -- particularly inconsistent
Rooms that are too hot
Ticking clocks
Dripping sinks
things you hear thru thin hotel walls!
Doors that slam (and people who slam them)
Or when you hear elephants walking upstairs
Loud people in hallways
Or trains through windows



-- Transportation --
12- Rental Cars 
= Shuttles that are hot and stuffy
= Rental Car: The upsell on everything
= Bad car smell in general, and of smoke
= Dirty windshields, mirrors
= Headlights that don‚Äôt work (yes, this has happened to me)
= Trunks that are full of water (yes, this too)
= Parking meters that only take coins.  It‚Äôs 2018 already!
13 - Trains and Subway
= Trains that are late!
= NYC Subway entrances for a certain direction
= Subway: People who can‚Äôt wait for you to get off before they get on

14 - Out and about:
Selfie sticks
Pictures with Ipads
VIdeo with ipad

15 - Rudeness
= People who feel they are ‚Äúsuper special‚Äù -- ‚ÄúDo you know who I am?‚Äù
Travel Forums
Leaving trash everywhere.  Pick up your crap!
Ugly Americans

And finally just because I really hate FEES:
Hidden Fees for everything!
Baggage fees, Resorts fees, etc, etc, etc!

Q98J4e5QLt4,17 Foods You Can Eat As Much As You Want To,"How to eat and lose weight? How to stay slim without diets or gym? There are foods you can eat without risk of¬†gaining weight. 
Let‚Äôs be¬†honest; it‚Äôs hard to¬†resist cravings for tasty food when you‚Äôre on¬†a¬†strict diet. You feel hungry all the time, and when you open the fridge, it‚Äôs almost impossible to¬†fight the temptation to¬†grab something unhealthy! 
However, there are foods you can eat without risk of¬†gaining weight. Can you imagine eating popcorn at any time and in any quantity?! To figure out how that‚Äôs possible, watch our list of foods that will never make you fat.

TIMESTAMPS
Celery 0:44
Arugula 1:15
Egg whites 1:38
Salad 2:09
Cucumbers 2:41
Cauliflower 3:12
Tomatoes 4:00
Broccoli 4:27
Oranges 4:55
Kale 5:19
Sugar snap peas 5:43
Grapefruit 6:03
Melon 6:26
Strawberries 6:46
Blackberries 7:10
Popcorn 7:28
Blueberries 7:54

SUMMARY
- Celery has anti-allergic and antiseptic properties. This plant can improve your digestion and overall health. 
- There are only 10¬†calories in¬†2¬†cups of¬†arugula. It¬†helps you get slimmer¬†without damaging your health. 
- Scientists found that eggs keep you feeling full for longer periods than foods that contain more carbs. Mix the whites with a¬†few tomatoes and get the healthiest omelet ever! 
- Salad is¬†packed with¬†vitamins¬†A and C¬†as well as¬†folic acid and iron. It‚Äôs practically¬†devoid of¬†calories (10 to 20 calories, depending on the type).
- Fresh, crunchy cucumbers¬†have significant health benefits. The skin of¬†a¬†cucumber contains most of¬†its nutritional value, particularly¬†beta-carotene, which is¬†good for your eyes. 
- Cauliflower is¬†an¬†excellent source of¬†vitamins¬†C and K.¬†Also, it contains only 25 calories. 
- One tomato has about 25 calories. Tomatoes are full of¬†lycopene, vitamins A, C, and¬†B2, folic acid, fiber, chromium, and potassium.¬†
- Broccoli contains 31 calories, and it is one of¬†the favorite foods of¬†those who want to lose weight. 
- Oranges are one of¬†the most delicious fruits. They are best known for their¬†vitamin C¬†content.¬†By¬†the way, the white stuff under the orange skin, the pith, is really good for you. 
- Kale, like any other edible seaweed, contains¬†a¬†large amount of¬†iodine¬†and it‚Äôs almost¬†devoid of¬†calories. It has about 32 calories. 
- Sugar snap peas are very low in¬†calories: a¬†cup of¬†peas contains around 35¬†calories. 
- Grapefruits help to¬†stabilize blood sugar levels. They‚Äôre full of¬†vitamin¬†C,¬†and, due to¬†their low caloric value, they can help you reduce those extra inches around your waist. 
-  Melon¬†contains over half the recommended daily value of¬†vitamins¬†A and¬†C and only 55 calories. Melon is also very useful for preventing flu and improving the immune system.
- Strawberries are rich in¬†potassium and fiber¬†and have¬†an¬†anti-inflammatory effect. It sounds surprising, but a couple of strawberries contain as much vitamin C as an orange. 
- Blackberries are full of¬†antioxidants and vitamin C.¬†Also, they have an¬†amazing taste. 
- One cup of¬†air-popped popcorn will never affect your body. This ‚Äúmovie snack‚Äù¬†mostly consists of¬†air,¬†and you can enjoy eating it¬†without fear of¬†gaining extra weight. 
- Blueberries¬†have more antioxidants than any other fruit.¬†Therefore, a¬†cup of¬†blueberries¬†will help you balance your diet.¬†

Abstract: Free boundaries are mathematical manifestations of sharp changes in the parameters that describe a given problem. Typically, different physical laws are to be prescribed in distinct, a priori unknown subregions. This is the case, for instance, of problems involving different states of matter. Free boundaries also arise in physical reactions where interfaces retain some portion of the system‚Äôs energy, viz., latent heat, membranes, dead cores, flux balances, and so forth. The development of the contemporary free boundary theory has promoted major knowledge leverage across pure and applied sciences and in this talk I will provide a panoramic overview of such endeavor. Towards the end, I will describe how geometric insights pertaining to the systematic study of free boundary problems can be imported as to investigate regularity issues in nonlinear diffusive partial differential equations, leading to a plethora of unanticipated results.",Science and Technology

7. Dead Man Burgers
  Sure this burger verges on the violent side, but the cartoonish faces the food makes kinda makes up for it. Kinda. What‚Äôs better is that making these don‚Äôt call for overly complicated ingredients or methods. It‚Äôs all the stuff you would regularly put in a burger, just with a little more effort and energy. But really, how hard is it to make mustard and ketchup eyes? What‚Äôs even better, other than the fact this particular photo is that of a vegan burger, is that depending if you‚Äôre a fan of lots of ketchup on your burgers, you can make it as messy as you want. If you wanted to do the most, you could also carve teeth into the hamburger buns and up the ketchup slathering. The only out of the ordinary thing you would need is a gingerbread cookie cut out.









6. Dog Eat Dog
  This is the much more scaredy-cat friendly alternative to the man eating burger. Mayumi, who runs the blog ‚Äútaste of japan‚Äù  made these hot dog eating puppies by first shaping the buns and baking them herself, complete with cute black bean noses and eyes.























5. Panda Curry
  A plate of curry‚Äôs never looked more adorable. These rice balls wrapped in seaweed swimming towards a lake of food is too cute to eat--though it looks pretty good to eat, too. It seems that rice balls are really versatile foods and are always incorporated into cute food art ideas.




















4. Sugarcube Skulls
  There‚Äôs nothing more ordinary than your everyday cup of joe. So if you want to spice things up in the morning and you‚Äôre inclined towards the more gothic and creepy, you can use these cool skull and bones shaped sugar pieces instead of regular cubes, packets or spoonfuls of the stuff. Artist Snow Violent came up with these bones shaped sugar cubes under their Sugar Skulls series. And honestly, edible art is the best kind of art. Or edible anything, really.

























3. Finger Sandwiches
  Literally, these are finger sandwiches. Online, you‚Äôll find the recipe for these snacks up the name of ‚ÄúCreepy, Dead Man‚Äôs Fingers Sandwiches. They seem strangely real, but they‚Äôre apparently really easy to make. All you need is bread (any kind of your choosing) butter, a spread like cream cheese or peanut butter, almonds for the fingernails and strawberry jam for the bloody mess. Actually, it sounds like it would taste quite fine, even if it looks creepy.",Food

4rrqc3Skwr8,22 CRAZY FOOD HACKS YOU HAVE TO TRY,"DELICIOUS DISHES FOR A PARTY
We love candies and share a lot of ideas you can make using sweets. If you want to amaze your guests try to cook dishes we share! Make a cool decoration for a cake made from pears and candies. You can create a perfect flower that looks real. Make a huge lollipop with candies inside. It will be a perfect gift for kids. Decorate a cupcake with a flower made from lollipop and marshmallow. It will be a super cute flower for your candy bar. 
Another awesome idea is to make a lollipop out of sprite! Take a bowl a pour sprite, add food coloring and gelatin. Pour the mix into a mold for lollipops and freeze.  
Do you want to cook something special for your home party? The recipe of black ice-cream: take a bowl and add heavy cream, sugar and activated charcoal. Beat the mixture and add dry rice. And mix again. This perfect dessert will amaze your friends! Moreover, we have one more cool idea to surprise your friends - vegan caviar. Take a pan and pour water into it, add sriracha and agar-agar and mix these ingredients. Simmer agar-agar and sriracha for two minutes. Take a tall glass and pour vegetable oil, put into the fridge and let cool. When the vegetable oil is cold, take a syringe and squeeze out spheres of the hot mixture into the cold oil. You will see bead shapes appearing that will sink to the bottom of the glass. To separate the oil from pearls wash them with some water. Now you have fake caviar to decorate a cake or everything you like!
Camembert bread will be the best dish during your party. Cut off the top of the bread loaf, make a hole large enough to fit the camembert. Next, cut the top of camembert and place into the hole.

I don't know about you guys but for me breakfast is everything! Not only I try to make my breakfasts nutricious and yummy but I also try to make them look good. Because stylish and fun breakfast sets great mood for the working day. So here's the hack. I guess everybody has some eggs and sausages in the fridge pretty much all the time. You'll need 4 and a half sausages. First of all, cut every sausage in halves. Then cut every half in half again. And join two parts together with a toothpick. Now put these sausages in the form of a star on the frying pan and break three eggs inside of the star.

Because stylish and fun breakfast sets great mood for the working day. So here's the hack. I guess everybody has some eggs and sausages in the fridge pretty much all the time. You'll need 4 and a half sausages. First of all, cut every sausage in halves. Then cut every half in half again. And join two parts together with a toothpick. Now put these sausages in the form of a star on the frying pan and break three eggs inside of the star. When your starry eggs are ready take out the toothpicks and add some tomatoes and greens to your liking! ; )

PdtliDrPYYA,25 Worst TRAVEL MISTAKES and How to Avoid Them,"Travel is fun, but can be frustrating if you make too many mistakes.  Here are the top 25 travel mistakes I see travelers make these days and HOW to avoid them.  Learn from my and other people's mistakes and enjoy more stress-free relaxing travel!

1 - Having too full of an itinerary
 Part of travel is exploring.  You should have some slack time in your agenda

2 - Underestimating travel/train times
 It‚Äôs no fun spending ALL DAY on trains/planes/automobiles and not actually seeing anything

3 - Overpacking
 You don‚Äôt need your whole house!
 Just weighs you down.
 If you can just bring a carryon that‚Äôs the best!
 Need room for stuff you buy too

4 - Underpacking
 Shorts and t-shirt weather?  
Might be good to have at least one pair of pants, and long sleeves

5 - Impossibly short connections
 If the airline let me book it, it must be OK right????
 Arriving in to LHR and departing from LGW, or (NRT, HND)

6 - Booking separate tickets as a connection
 If the flights aren‚Äôt in the same PNR, you are usually out of luck
 
7 - Not realizing that a ‚Äúdirect‚Äù flight is not the same as a non-stop
 Why does my ‚Äúdirect‚Äù flight from LA to New York take 9 hours?

8 - Not paying attention to all the fees -- Booking Spirit Airlines
Up to $65 to carry-on a bag if paid at the gate

9 - Booking Afternoon departure flights
The most ‚Äúon-time‚Äù flights are generally first thing in the morning.  Afternoon flights have to arrive from some place, which can lead to delays.  
East coast thunderstorms.
 
10 - Booking flights that arrive in the dead of night
 Yes, the flight might be cheaper.  Good luck getting transport in to the city.

11 - Not selecting a seat ahead of time
 If it‚Äôs possible to select a seat, do it.  
If you don‚Äôt select a seat then you might not actually be flying on that plane.
 Or do you like the last row next to the toilet?

12 - Not checking visa requirements before you get to the airport
 No fun to get turned away at the airline counter because of no Visa
 Your passport should be valid too!  Needs at least 6 months validity.

13 - Not checking in online
 If the plane is weight limited, and you are last to checkin, too bad for you.

14 - Not getting money at the airport
Hunting for that perfect currency exchange place to save $10 isn‚Äôt worth it.  
Just use the airport ATM and have some cash when you hit the city.  
Don‚Äôt expect the taxi to take credit cards either.

15 - Taking the airport share-ride shuttle
 This is the worst $20 you‚Äôll ever save for wasting 90 minutes of your life.
 Don‚Äôt save money at the expense of time.  How much did you pay for those flights?

16 - Not checking hotel prices before you book your flights
 Cheap flights to Tokyo in April?  Because the hotels are $1,000 a night!

17 - Booking hotels in the middle of nowhere to save $10
 Spending $20 extra on transportation, and 60 minutes each way to the city

18 - Not paying attention to flights across the date line, or the red eye
 Make sure your hotel is booked for the actual day you arrive. 
Not the day before, or after.

19 - Not signing up for rewards programs (Airlines, Hotels, Rental Cars)
You‚Äôre throwing money down the drain.
   
20 - Not getting an international data plan, or a foreign sim card
 Then realizing you‚Äôre getting charged some exorbitant amount

21 - Not printing out your travel/reservation details
 Phone battery dead?  Wifi doesn‚Äôt work?  Paper always does!

22 - Wearing lousy footwear
 Nothing worse than a nice big blister to start your trip on the first day
 Good socks too!

23 - Not paying attention to the thieves that are paying attention to you
 Pickpockets love tourists.  Don‚Äôt be a victim!  Be sharp!
 Don‚Äôt be overly trusting
 Scam artists love tourists.  
Random dude at the airport with a taxi might not be that honest
Offer to take you photo, and take your camera
Gypsies love to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù you with subway ticket machines

24 - Never leaving the tourist areas

25 - Only eating familiar foods

26 - Getting bummed out over delays/cancellations/bad weather

27 - Not putting down the camera

28 - Not watching Yellow Productions Before you Go!

J3H4qIWx9Tc,34 DELICIOUS FOOD HACKS WITH CHEESE AND OTHER GOODIES,"Simple recipes with cheese for everyone

There is no denying that cheese is delicious, especially when it comes to cooking with cheese. There are limitless recipes you can try with all different varieties of cheese, such as mozzarella, parmesan cheese or cheddar cheese. Since it is such a delicious ingredient for cooking and filled with protein we created some simple and delicious recipes with cheese that can try right away. In addition, we included some bonus cooking hacks and tips to make your time in the kitchen more enjoyable.

1. Simplest macaroni and cheese recipe.
If you are at work or would like to have macaroni and cheese as a snack instead of making a huge pot of food. Try this little trick that will literally take you 3 minutes to make this meal. In a mug, add a scoop of pasta, then, add the adequate amount of water and microwave for 2 minutes. Stir it really well and make sure there is no more water left in the mug. Then add some milk and cheese and stir until the cheese into the mug and Bon Appetite.

2. Delicious cheese toastie recipe
If you would like to have a nice cheese toast fast but you don't own a grill, don't let that stop you. Apply some butter on a slice of bread on both sides, then, add two slices of cheddar cheese and then another slice of bread with butter spread on it. Then, place your sandwich in a kitchen foil and seal it. After that, take your clothing iron and place it on top of the toastie for a couple of minutes max, then turn it and press the other side as well with your clothing iron and, there you have it.

3. DIY cheddar sticks
This might as well be the most delicious treat in the whole world. Take a block of cheddar cheese and cut it in rectangular blocks. Place one wooden stick in each block. Then, dip it into flour, after that dip it into an egg wash, and finally in breadcrumbs. Lastly, boil some oil and fry your cheesy sticks. Enjoy with some ketchup or the sauce of your choice.

4. Oil Hack!
Instead of accidentally pouring excess oil on your food or your frying pan. Pour some oil in a clean spray bottle and start spraying. This way you'll be able to monitor how much oil you consume and also keep your meals healthier.

5.How to make your own iced coffee
Make your filter coffee, or your espresso, or your instant coffee with hot water as you would normally do with or without sugar. (Do Not add milk). Then pour it into your ice tray and place it in the freezer. When it's time for you to have a nice glass of iced coffee, instead of running to the closest coffee shop, just take 5-6 cubes of the iced coffee you prepared, place them in a glass with some milk or water and stir. Enjoy!

Human history is truly a swinging pendulum of ups and downs. The centuries have been sprinkled with both terrible, bleak events, and beautiful hopeful moments.

Since the invention of the photograph, those events and moments have been recorded for us, allowing us a window into a time that we never actually got to see for ourselves.

hF_afgUGbcI,7 Astonishing Real Mermaid Sightings From History,"Since the beginning of recorded history, legends have been born surrounding the elegant, beautiful, and sometimes treacherous mermaid. Their siren songs, beautiful looks, and ocean dwelling lifestyle has made the mermaid an enigma in the minds of people everywhere. Cultures across the world have their own versions of this magical being, from the ningyo of Japan to Ariel of Disney fame. A question does come to mind at the mention of mermaids: are they real? For centuries, people from all walks of life have claimed to see this myth in the flesh. Are they real sightings? Are they tricks of the light and the eye? Are people feigning mermaid discoveries for the attention and publicity? It seems history has not answered any of those questions, as sightings are still occurring to this day. Is the mermaid a legend, or is her powerful song still pulling people into her mythical realm?

When someone asks us a question ‚ÄúWhat do we really know about our world?‚Äù we might as well reply everything or nothing. And both these answers are wrong and right at the same time. We in Smart is the New Sexy want to scour through every page of history books and prove that some facts aren‚Äôt facts at all, they are LIES! 

Confused? Of course, we know some things, pieces of general information about the universe, historical events, and personalities. However, when it comes to facts and dates from the past we rely only on one kind of source - history books. Some of us believe that the information we can find in there can‚Äôt be 100% trusted, because, let‚Äôs put this straight, some of the facts are really doubtful.

QKae1k1BDdA,A brie(f) history of cheese - Paul Kindstedt,"Check out our Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/teded

View full lesson: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/a-brie-f-history-of-cheese-paul-s-kindstedt

Before empires and royalty, before pottery and writing, before metal tools and weapons ‚Äì there was cheese. As early as 8000 BCE, Neolithic farmers began a legacy of cheesemaking almost as old as civilization. Today, the world produces roughly 22 billion kilograms of cheese a year, shipped and consumed around the globe. Paul Kindstedt shares the history of one of our oldest and most beloved foods. 

Lesson by Paul S. Kindstedt, directed by Charlotte Cambon.

Check out my new website here! https://www.simonoxfphys.com/

Note that there's a huge amount about pi that I didn't cover in this video due to time - I didn't even mention proofs of it being irrational and transcendental, or why we call it pi! I chose to focus on the development of its approximation as a hook to teach the broader history of mathematics, rather than make this video an exhaustive list of facts. The wiki is a great place to learn more about the rest of the number's history and applications in maths and physics: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi#History 

A few nitpicky things:
- I made mistakes distinguishing between 'digits of pi calculated' and 'decimal points of pi calculated' in some sections, so it is possible that this error is elsewhere without me knowing.
- Archimedes didn't do his approximation with squares, he started with hexagons and then increased the order of the polygon. I chose to present the zeroth order version of his algorithm using squares for simplicity, but note that this is not what he did.
- Something which got lost from the final version of this video is my argument that during the Age of Enlightenment pi shifted from being a physical (measured) constant to a purely logical (theoretical) one. This then embodies the philosophical shift in society at the time. This is hinted at but not fully explained, so I thought I'd put this here.
- Lastly, I am truly sorry for the pronunciations which I doubtlessly completely murdered in this video. At least I spared you my attempt at Chinese.

I am hugely indebted to Alex Bellos and his excellent book Alex's Adventures in Numberland for the inspiration to make this video. There is an entire chapter of the book devoted to a broader but shallower discussion of pi and its history, which I highly recommend.

   http://moyaokruga.ru/niva/Articles.aspx?articleId=209215

The competition was attended by pupils of the Children's Art School, who were prepared for it's performance by conductors teachers of this institution of additional education. The concert program included 26 everything numbers. It's includes a playing on musical instruments (solo performance) and dance numbers. For the first time, the jury presented the artworks of children studying at the art department of the School of Arts, also included musical and choreographic compositions, puppet shows.

The jury, which included: a methodologist of the department for coordinating the activities of educational organizations in the region of the Saratov regional educational and methodological center N.Ye. Mikhailova, lecturer of the cyclic commission ""Choral Conducting"" of the Saratov Regional College of Arts by name O.V. Oschepkova, a teacher of the highest category of the Central Children's Music School in Saratov, Ye.G. Alferova, teacher of the highest category of the Children's Art School.by name V.V. Kovaleva municipal formation ""City of Saratov"" T.V. Chubarov.
 I had to closely monitor the performance of the participants of the competition. To say that the guys and girls were not worried would be wrong. Of course, they long time and stubbornly went to it's concert to showing their skill and talent performed at this stage.

And to look, really was what here in. The vocal and choral group by name ""Arioso"" by  woman conductor  E.S.Senckevich, always amazes with it's many tember voices and vocal singing skills, the ability to perform virtuosly work in one breath there. But this time, the guys have surpassed themselves, I'm think. 
Valentina Alontseva, Yaroslav Kisilyov, with her playing the accordion, showed how close this instrument is to them too.
 Egor Zimenkov, Ivan Stepantsov, Ali Isengaliev, Alexei Baranov with the support of teacher of children's schools by accordion class N.A. Shvydkovoy forced the viewer no breath. Polina Galitskaya, Maria Gulak, Maria Oleinikova, Sarsen Incarbekova (upright piano) and others were able to subordinate grand piano, make it laugh and sob theirs playing. The performance of Nikita Kutakhin and Andrei Kulzhanov, known as the duo ""NikAnder"", took place nice again.
The ""dance"", a children's dance group known in the region, "" has flashing"" on the dance floor, adding to the grace and plasticity the brightness of theirs costumes and owns enthusiasm that was passed to all those who came to see and support the contestants on this important day.

The jury had the opportunity to evaluate the performance of the guys from ""CANAREYKA"" original name (canary-finch) puppet theater. Although the artists themselves are not visible during the performance, they tried to convey the emotions and feelings to theirs dolls, playing as sincerely as possible so that the viewer believed in the reality of what was happening here.

Christina Skrypnyk performed in the nomination ""solo performance, vocal"". Her performance fascinated the members of the jury, and it was she who passed the final selection. Art school teachers hope that our young ‚Äústar‚Äù will take part in the gala concert, which will be held in the regional center (Saratov city). And we wish her good luck and we shall believe and hope in her victory in!

Millions of Americans currently struggle with hunger, and those numbers are on the rise. And while the price of fresh food has risen in recent decades, junk food remains plentiful and often cheap. For many of the hungry in America, the extra pounds that result from a poor diet are a side effect of hunger itself.

These maps depict the evolution of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel burning, cement production and gas flaring worldwide from 1750 until 2010. In addition to a valuable insight into emissions history, this also provides a striking visualization of the progressive extension of the industrial revolution over the past 250 years.

Each dot represents the total carbon dioxide emitted in a given year from a 5' by 5' cell (5' = 1/12th of a degree), the redder the lower, the brighter the higher.

These maps have been produced by combining CDIAC national carbon dioxide emissions time series with EDGAR/HYDE 3.2 decadal population dataset (interpolated using Akima interpolation) from 1750 to 2010.

This result in global dataset of gridded yearly emissions over the entire period, at a 5' resolution.

Emissions data from CDIAC.

Up7TerdRqYw,"A Symphony of Science, Music and Art | Ramya Mohan | TEDxRVCE","Dr.Ramya Mohan brings together two elements which most people consider different, science and art. Music and art can be healing to the body and mind and she paints a beautiful picture for us showing how the two can come together in the form of the 'Creative Mind'. She strongly believes in the therapeutic power of music and uses it to aid recovery from illness. Dr. Ramya Mohan is a psychiatrist, artist, analyst, musician and an educator who is bridging the gap between neuroscience, mental health and creative arts to support brains better. Trained and qualified at both India and the UK, Dr. Mohan specializes in Child and Adult Psychiatry. An Autism champion for the South Surrey Autism board, Dr Mohan is passionate about bringing art and music together with the mind. In 2015, Dr Mohan founded iMANAS London, an organisation which aims to promote the integration of medicine, arts and neuroscience. A highly skilled artist and musician, Dr. Mohan travels the world as an invited guest speaker to discuss her work; her artworks have been displayed in exhibitions in both the UK and India. A formally trained Carnatic and Hindustani singer, Dr. Mohan believes in the therapeutic power of music and uses it to aid recovery from illness. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",Art and Music

The Mughal Empire (also referred to as Baburid Empire, Baburid Dynasty) was founded by Zahiriddin Muhammad Babur, a Timurid prince and ruler from Turan or Turkistan, i.e. Central Asia (Uzbekistan). Babur was a direct descendant to the Turkic Emperor Timur on his father's side and also had links to Chagatai, the second son of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, on his mother‚Äôs side.Ousted from his ancestral domains in Turkistan by Sheybani Khan, the 14-year old Prince Babur turned to India to satisfy his ambitions. He established himself in Kabul and then pushed steadily southward into India from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass. Babur's forces occupied much of northern India after his victory at Panipat in 1526. The preoccupation with wars and military campaigns, however, did not allow the new emperor to consolidate the gains he had made in India.The instability of the empire became evident under his son, Humayun, who was driven out of India and into Persia by rebels.Humayun's exile in Persia established diplomatic ties between the Safavid and Mughal Courts, and led to increasing West Asian cultural influence in the Mughal court. The restoration of Mughal rule began after Humayun‚Äôs triumphant return from Persia in 1555, but he died from a fatal accident shortly afterwards.Humayun's son, Akbar, succeeded to the throne under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped consolidate the Mughal Empire in India.

Through warfare and diplomacy, Akbar was able to extend the empire in all directions, and controlled almost the entire Indian subcontinent north of the Godavari river. He created a new class of nobility loyal to him from the military aristocracy of India's social groups, implemented a modern government and supported cultural developments. At the same time Akbar intensified trade with European trading companies. The Indian historian Abraham Eraly wrote that foreigners were often impressed by the fabulous wealth of the Mughal court, but the glittering court hid darker realities, namely that about a quarter of the empire's gross national product was owned by 655 families while the bulk of India's 120 million people lived in appalling poverty.After suffering what appears to have been an epileptic seizure in 1578 while hunting tigers, which he regarded as a religious experience, Akbar grew disenchanted with Islam, and came to embrace a syncretistic mixture of Hinduism and Islam.Akbar allowed free expression of religion and attempted to resolve socio-political and cultural differences in his empire by establishing a new religion, Din-i-Ilahi, with strong characteristics of a ruler cult. He left his successors an internally stable state, which was in the midst of its golden age, but before long signs of political weakness would emerge. Akbar's son, Jahangir, ruled the empire at its peak, but he was addicted to opium, neglected the affairs of the state, and came under the influence of rival court cliques. During the reign of Jahangir's son, Shah Jahan, the culture and splendour of the luxurious Mughal court reached its zenith as exemplified by the Taj Mahal.The maintenance of the court, at this time, began to cost more than the revenue

Songs From the Northern Territory 4: Aboriginal Music From North-Eastern Arnhem Land Including Groote Eylandt 
Artist/Collector: 
Alice Moyle 
Label Information: 
Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS): AIAS 4 CD 
Media Type: 
CD 
Year: 
Recorded 1963; Released 1997 
Availability: 
AIATSIS 

Notes: For the purpose of music description, Eastern Arnhem Land of the Northern 
Territory is divided here as follows: the north-eastern sector including offshore 
islands; the eastern sector, extending along the coast as far south as the Roper 
River; and the Groote Eylandt archipelago north-west of the Gulf of Carpentaria. 
Field recordings reproduced on this compact disc were collected at Milingimbi and 
Yirrkala in the north-eastern sector and at Angurugu and Umbakumba on Groote Eylandt.
 
The Aboriginal communities at Milingimbi and Yirrkala, together with the people at 
Galiwin'ku (previously known as Elcho Island) have been referred to in the 
anthropological literature as the Murngin (WL Warner) and Wulamba (RM Berndt). More 
recently, they have become known as the Yolngu, from a local word meaning 'people'. 
The people on Groote Eylandt were known by mainland groups as the Wayingurra and 
their language, Ingurra. In the absence of a name for the Groote Eylandters, 
Warnindilyakwa, a name formerly given to one of the larger clans on the island, is 
sometimes used. Anindilyakwa is the name of the island language. 
Item characteristics of Eastern Arnhem Land clan songs performed and recorded in 
the 1960s-all of which were sung by men-are summarised here as follows: (1) a didjeridu 
accompaniment which utilises two tones differing widely in pitch (the interval between 
the higher or overblown tone and the fundamental often sounding close to a tenth 
but varying according to the shape and length of the hollowed branch); (2) a narrow 
vocal range of pitch (compare them, for instance, with Western Arnhem Land songs) 
which rarely exceeds a fifth or sixth and may be less than a second; (3) song words 
which are translatable, meaningful and appropriate to relevant clan territories 
and related myths; and (4) the occurrence of an unaccompanied vocal termination (UVT), 
or termination of a song item by voice or voices alone after the accompanying 
instruments have ceased. Good examples of this fourth item characteristic are to be 
heard on this disc (Track 1) and disc 3 (Track 11). 
Song refrains may consist of repeated strings of words and syllables, a prolonged 
single syllable or a repeated pattern of vocal sounds (for example, bird calls). 
These calls are incorporated into the particular sectional or phraselike structure 
of many item sequences performed in Eastern Arnhem Land. 
On Groote Eylandt (tracks 7-13), only the first three of the above characteristics 
are to be heard. There is no occurrence of the UVT in these items but the following 
additional characteristics distinguish emeba (Groote Eylandt clan songs) from manikay 
(north-eastern Arnhem Land clan songs): 
a. the shaky voice, a deliberate manner of vocal ornamentation used by some emeba singers; 
b. the break or brief cessation of the vocal part of a Groote Eylandt clan song which is 
signalled by certain words the singer chooses to sing (the song subject at this point may 
fall, swoop down, or change abruptly in some way-it was said that the break gives the singer 
time to decide which words to sing next); 
c. a short, patterned interplay between sticks and didjeridu during the break; and 
d. the general clatter of stick-beating percussion arising from several different sources 
at the same time. 
Further comparison of emeba and manikay reveals that, whereas the durations of the latter 
are usually about one minute or less, emeba items may last for more than two minutes each.

dRMF9lC0tXs,Additive Manufacturing - Laser Deposition Technology LDT:,"Additive Manufacturing - Laser Deposition Technology (LDT):
------------------------------------------------------------------

Laser Deposition Technology (LDT) is a process in which metal powder is injected into the focused beam of a high-power laser under tightly controlled atmospheric conditions. The focused laser beam melts the surface of the target material and generates a small molten pool of base material. Powder delivered into this same spot is absorbed into the melt pool, thus generating a deposit that may range from 0.125 to 1 mm thick and 1 to 4 mm wide. The resulting deposits may then be used to build or repair metal parts for a variety of different applications.

There are three main areas where LDT can be used in manufacturing processes; it can be used in repair of worn components, especially in any type of mechanical equipment with moving parts. This process is known as Laser Repair Technology (LRT). Also, this technique can be used in the application of cladding materials, which known as Laser Cladding Technology (LCT). LCT is a process that repairs surfaces on parts by first machining down the worn surface and building it back up by depositing cladding material in thin layers to restore the worn surface. Finally, this technique can be used in performing near-net-shape freeform builds, which known as Laser Freeform Manufacturing Technology (LFMT). This technique starts with a CAD drawing of a part, from this electronic drawing, a tool path file is built. The laser deposition system then builds the part layer by layer. LFMT can build complex shapes, prototyping and manufacturing some parts in far less time than any other technique.

L3CkzQQFZXs,Additive Manufacturing - LASERTEC 65 3D,"The unique combination of laser deposition welding with a powder nozzle and milling on the LASERTEC 65 3D, is an innovative generative machining method. It allows a faster production of complex geometries and individual 3D-parts. Especially large components up to √ò 500 mm can be produced cost-effectively with this hybrid solution. The flexible changeover between laser and milling operations enables the direct machining of areas that can no longer be reached later on the finished part. The laser process uses a metal powder feed, which allows the additive manufacture of parts without a processing chamber nor the need for a supporting structures. The additive process is up to 10 times faster than the generation in a powder bed. DMG MORI is offering the complete process chain, starting with the NC-programming in the hybrid CAD / CAM system, via the usage of proven technology parameters coming from a material data base, through to machining operations, process monitoring and documentation.",Manufacturing

7n8bPPkWiOk,Advanced Pharmaceutical Manufacturing,"There are a number of challenges that the industry faces in order to transition towards more competitive, systematic and efficient manufacturing. Regulatory authorities have recognized the deficiencies of pharmaceutical product manufacturing and aim to enhance process understanding through Quality by Design (QbD) and Process Analytical Technology (PAT) tools. As a result of this current effort to change the mindset in order to mimic the rest of the chemical industry, an additional transition is becoming more and more appealing: transition from batch to continuous production mode. However, continuous manufacturing requires detailed process understanding in terms of the evolution of all critical material properties as a function of its operating parameters and environmental conditions. Once process knowledge is translated into models, computer aided dynamic simulation tools will allow the design, analysis and optimization of continuous integrated processes. 

In this talk I will discuss the work that has been done in my lab towards the development of an integrated platform that will enable the efficient flowsheet simulation and analysis, the assessment of design alternatives, the feasibility analysis of the production line, and the control and optimization of process design and operations. 

The developed flowsheet model includes modules for all the necessary unit operations, namely powder feeding, mixing, roller compaction, tablet press and milling integrated to represent a tablet manufacturing line. Models used to represent each unit operation vary from empirical, first-principle or hybrid. Population balance models are developed in order to track the composition and particle size changes throughout complex powder processes dynamically. The developed flowsheet simulation is used to predict the propagation of upstream disturbances to final product quality, the assessment of recycle stream benefits, the identification of process integration bottlenecks and evaluation of different control strategies in order to retain the process within its design space. In addition, global dynamic sensitivity analysis is performed to identify critical process parameters not only within each unit operation, but also between different processes. Finally, simulation based optimization techniques enable the identification of the optimal operating conditions, as well as the optimal design sequence which leads to pharmaceutical tablets with desired characteristics. This work aims to merge knowledge, experience, experimental results and modeling tools for developing a dynamic simulation platform that will enable the safe implementation of the transition towards continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing.

jLuVFq3nQuI,Africa And Her Abundant Contributions To Modern Technology.,"Chiefdryno talks about Africa's contributions to the world in regards to  modern technology.

I present this information, which is nothing new, only hidden, to they family that we Africans are very smart and intelligent people and we very creative and innovative when it comes to Science and  Technology.
The article i presented is about a young African-American by the name Iddris Sandu (affiliated with Uber, Google, Apple, Instagram etc). The 21 year old has earned the name ‚ÄúTech-Guru‚Äù for his many contributions to modern technology.
Iddris Sandu is one of a multitude of people of African descent that have invented great things which has fueled the technological advancements of the world that we see too... ig the computer, gps, electricity, algorithms, etc

Artificial intelligence (AI) is being employed in the private sector to optimize production processes, pricing, and other business functions. But apart from national security and law enforcement, productive uses in the public sector have received less attention, despite recognition that the administrative state's foremost challenges include efficient processing of ever-increasing amounts of data, and adapting to new information over time. Duke Law's Center for Innovation Policy, Duke Law's Center on Law & Technology, Duke Science & Society, and the Rethinking Regulation Program at the Kenan Institute of Ethics held a joint conference to explore promising uses of AI and the challenges they pose in administering diverse governmental functions involving science, technology, health and intellectual property.",Science and Technology

5-XDh6XInUk,Airline Miles Basics: 15 Things to Know To Earn More Miles,"Things YOU need to know to maximize the amount of airline miles you earn.  I explain Airline rewards programs that can often be confusing and complicated.  Don‚Äôt let your airline miles go to waste, they are yours.. you earned them!  Well.. as long as you put in your frequent flyer number!

1 - Why earn miles?
Simple.. free flights! Or upgrades!
If you dont like to travel, you are probably in the wrong place
People often ask me how I can afford to travel so much.
Simple answer: miles

2 - How do you earn them?
Flying
Credit cards
Shopping portals
Rental Cars
Partner deals
When the airline makes a mistake
Transfer in

3 - Revenue based vs distance based
These programs started based on distance
But now are typically somehow based on revenue.  
Usually a complicated formula based on dollars spent,  class of service, elite status, and maybe distance flown

4 - What about elite qualifying miles?
These are earned typically in a calendar year to qualify for a certain tier.  Elite miles reset annually and can't be ‚Äúredeemed‚Äù for anything. 

5 - Redemptions for anything else besides travel is a bad deal

6 - Not all miles and points are equal
Every airline has it's own award chart, United miles generally more valuable than Delta Skymiles
Surcharges can sometimes be crazy
Having a transferable currency is more valuable because of transfer options

7 - Premium class travel gets you the best redemption value
Often best on that airlines metal, other carriers may cost more.
Upgrades can sometimes be worthwhile if the copay is reasonable
Avoid British Airways

8 - Not all award options are online
Often have to call the airline to book

9 - Sign up for a rewards program even if you are only going to take 1 flight with the airline
Never know, it could be more.  Or that's at least a free magazine subscription 

10 - Focus or diversify?
Focus on one program in each alliance.
Star Alliance
One World
Sky Team
You can credit miles from one airline to your account with a different carrier in the same alliance.  Pay attention to the fare class. 

11 - Miles expire
Use something like awardwallet, or a spreadsheet to track them

12 - Mileage Run
Going the furthest for the cheapest price
Doesn't work on revenue based programs

13 - Credit Cards
My favorite way to earn
Ultimate Rewards are my favorite reward currency 
3 points on Chase Sapphire Reserve for travel

14 - Shopping Portals
Every airline has one
Look for the best earning portal
Usually a percentage of purchase price
But sometimes bonus lump sums

15 - Booking tips  
Award availability is typically not all seats
Sometimes the best awards are booked last minute
Or 365 days out.

3uOKebaeSi0,Allahabad Food Tour - Makhan ke ANDE - SAKODA (Spicy Pakoda) - Gulab Jamun (Allahabadi RASGULLA) 2/2,"The sheer amount of food to try in Allahabad is insane. Trust us, if you start exploring the streets for food you will not be disappointed. 

First Stop- Indian Coffee House
We started our day with the basics- coffee and keema omelette. Wait! Ok not so basic. The keema omelette serves as the perfect start to your day. It is not too spicy and not heavy either, but it will keep you stomach happy and satisfied.

Second Stop- Sheebu Omelette Shop
If you‚Äôre looking for that perfect breakfast and chai combination, this is the place to be. This 35 year old shop is known for serving some of the most buttery Bun- Omelette in the area. The omelette is very simple, it consists of onions, green chillies and coriander and cooked in a whole lot of butter. You can either go for the bun-omelette or a simple bun-butter, and boy do they use butter liberally! Enjoy all of this with a side of steaming hot chai.

Third Stop- VIP Rasgulla
For all those people who are going to get confused when they see Gulab Jamuns instead of Rasgullas, hold your horses people! In Allahabad, the humble gulab jamuns are known as rasgulla. VIP Rasgulla is known for some of the tastiest gulab jamun. These gulab jamuns have dried fruits and cardamom in the filling as well. Truly delicious!

Fourth Stop- Dehati Rasgulla Shop
Another famous rasgulla/gulab jamun shop. These gulab jamuns are slightly darker in colour since the khoya is cooked for a longer time is caramelized. These gulab jamuns are fried twice to get the deep dark colour that gives it a unique taste.

Fifth Stop- Sophiya Lawrence Betel Shop
The paan here is unlike any we have had. The stickiness that the normal meetha paan has because of the gulkand cannot be tasted in this paan. It is as smooth as butter. 

Sixth Stop- Pandit Ji ki Chaat
When it comes to chaat we really let loose. We tried a number of different dishes here. The gol gappas served here are not your run of the mill ones. They serve you gol gappa/pulki with a variety of fillings- with chickpeas and tamarind chutney, super hot and spicy sakoda curry or with dahi and tamarind chutney. They also give the Allahabadi classic Sakoda in a kulhad. Sakoda is a fritter made with pulses and spinach and served in a curry that is super hot. The Hara Aloo or basically aloo chaat is quite unique, with flavors of coriander and green chillies. Then to cool oneself down, go for the dahi badas.

Seventh Stop- Nirala Mishtan Bhandar
Here we tried the aloo ki tikiya that is nicely fried in desi ghee. It is topped with tamarind chutney, yoghurt, aloo lachha. This dish is super crispy and super tasty. Here also get the Kaali Gajar ke Halwa and some of the best laddus we have tried in a long time.

Eighth Stop- Hari Ram & Sons
This shop has been since 1890 serving dried samosas to worldwide and a lot more. The samosa is stuffed with potatoes and fried in desi ghee. These samosas are supposed to have a shelf life of a month.

Ninth Stop- Raja Ram Lassi
Right across Hari Ram & Sons is this lassi shop. Their lassi comes in the good old kulhad. It is thick and creamy and is flavoured with some saffron, and topped off with a layer of cream and rabri.

Tenth Stop- Shri Radhey Ras Kunj Sweet House
Another unique discovery was Makhan ke Andey at this place. The butter is shaped like an egg and has a filling of khoya mixed with saffron which ends up looking like a yolk.

Eleventh Stop- Ahmad Kabab Centre
This place is a Kabab lover‚Äôs delight! We tried the roasted chicken, haryali chicken, roasted chicken wings, and nizami chicken tikka. Everything is beautifully marinated here that the spices have literally seeped into every part of the chicken pieces.

Twelfth Stop- Bukhara Mughlai Khana
Our final stop was all about home cooked food. This place is known for meals that are cooked at home and sold to people to spread the joy. Here we had some shammi kababs, boti kabab and mutton in khara masala along with some ulte tawe ka paratha and roomali roti. Each and every dish was not too spicy  or oily and it tastes just like home.

delZeD7K95k,Amazing food processing machine #3,"Hello everyone,
Today I will introduce you the next part of compilation 's food processing machine; such as: burger machine, ice cream machine, noodle machine,... There are the food and fruit we use everyday. Let 's watched how it 's processing.
Thank you for watching and Hope you enjoy with this.

Food processing is the transformation of raw ingredients, by physical or chemical means into food, or of food into other forms. Food processing combines raw food ingredients to produce marketable food products that can be easily prepared and served by the consumer. Food processing typically involves activities such as mincing and macerating, liquefaction, emulsification, and cooking (such as boiling, broiling, frying, or grilling); pickling, pasteurization, and many other kinds of preservation; and canning or other packaging. (Primary-processing such as dicing or slicing, freezing or drying when leading to secondary products are also included.)
A machine is a tool containing one or more parts that uses energy to perform an intended action. Machines are usually powered by chemical, thermal, or electrical means, and are often motorized. Historically, a power tool also required moving parts to classify as a machine. However, the advent of electronics has led to the development of power tools without moving parts that are considered machines

- In the United States, Native Americans are people descended from the Pre-Columbian indigenous population of the land within the country's modern boundaries. These peoples were composed of numerous distinct tribes, bands, and ethnic groups, and many of these groups survive intact today as partially sovereign nations.

Since the end of the 15th century, the migration of Europeans to the Americas has led to centuries of population, cultural, and agricultural transfer and adjustment between Old and New World societies, a process known as the Columbian exchange. Most Native American groups had historically preserved their histories by oral traditions and artwork, which has resulted in the first written sources on the conflict being authored by Europeans.

In which John Green teaches you about American involvement in World War I, which at the time was called the Great War. They didn't know there was going to be a second one, though they probably should have guessed, 'cause this one didn't wrap up very neatly. So, the United States stayed out of World War I at first, because Americans were in an isolationist mood in the early 20th century. That didn't last though, as the affronts piled up and drew the US into the war. Spoiler alert: the Lusitania was sunk two years before we joined the war, so that wasn't the sole cause for our jumping in. It was part of it though, as was the Zimmerman telegram, unrestricted submarine warfare, and our affinity for the Brits. You'll learn the war's effects on the home front, some of Woodrow Wilson's XIV Points, and just how the war ended up expanding the power of the government in Americans' lives.

okcfKaC87r4,"American History Textbooks&#39; Lies: Everything Your Teacher Got Wrong - Myths, Education (1995)","Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong is a 1995 book by sociologist James W. Loewen. More about the book: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743296281/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0743296281&linkCode=as2&tag=tra0c7-20&linkId=fa2a943e54d4746ad736c9585ba27890

It critically examines twelve American history textbooks and concludes that textbook authors propagate factually false, Eurocentric, and mythologized views of history. In addition to critiquing the dominant historical themes presented in textbooks, Loewen presents a number of his own historical themes that he says are ignored by traditional history textbooks. A newly revised and updated hardcover edition was released on April 1, 2008. The New Press lists Lies My Teacher Told Me as its top all-time bestseller.

In Lies My Teacher Told Me, Loewen criticizes modern American history textbooks for containing incorrect information about people and events such as Christopher Columbus, the lies and inaccuracies in the history books regarding the dealings between the Europeans and the Native Americans, and their often deceptive and inaccurate teachings told about America's commerce in slavery. He further criticizes the texts for a tendency to avoid controversy and for their ""bland"" and simplistic style. He proposes that when American history textbooks elevate American historical figures to the status of heroes, they unintentionally give students the impression that these figures are superhumans who live in the irretrievable past. In other words, the history-as-myth method teaches students that America's greatest days have already passed. Loewen asserts that the muting of past clashes and tragedies makes history boring to students, especially groups excluded from the positive histories.

The twelve textbooks Loewen examined for the first edition are:
The American Adventure (1975)
American Adventures (1987)
American History (1982)
The American Pageant (1991)
The American Tradition (1984)
The American Way (1979)
The Challenge of Freedom (1990)
Discovering American History (1974)
Land of Promise (1983)
Life and Liberty (1984)
Triumph of the American Nation (1986)
The United States: A History of the Republic (1991)
In the second edition, Loewen added six more books; including a newer edition of The American Pageant:
The American Journey (2000)
The American Pageant (2006)
The Americans (2007)
America: Pathways to the Present (2005)
A History of the United States (2005)
Holt American Nation (2003)

Lies my Teacher Told Me is the winner of the 1996 American Book Award,[3] the Oliver Cromwell Cox Award for Distinguished Anti-Racist Scholarship, and the Critics Choice Award of the American Educational Studies Association. Sundown Towns was named one of ten Distinguished Books of 2005 by the Gustavus Myers Foundation.
Conservative activist David Horowitz has criticized some of Loewen's assertions for their partiality and inaccuracy, in particular questioning Loewen's claims about the relationship between American Indians and Columbus.

Lies My Teacher Told Me is mentioned in the novel Deadline by Chris Crutcher.
Lies My Teacher Told Me is mentioned in the liner notes of the Rise Against album, The Sufferer & the Witness.

QfsfoFqsFk4,American Imperialism: Crash Course US History #28,"In which John Green teaches you about Imperialism. In the late 19th century, the great powers of Europe were running around the world obtaining colonial possessions, especially in Africa and Asia. The United States, which as a young country was especially suceptible to peer pressure, followed along and snapped up some colonies of its own. The US saw that Spain's hold on its empire was weak, and like some kind of expansionist predator, it jumped into the Cuban War for Independence and turned it into the Spanish-Cuban-Phillipino-American War, which usually just gets called the Spanish-American War. John will tell you how America turned this war into colonial possessions like Puerto Rico, The Philippines, and almost even got to keep Cuba. The US was busy in the Pacific as well, wresting control of Hawaii from the Hawaiians. All this and more in a globe-trotting, oppressing episode of Crash Course US History.

9KzoHl0QqdQ,Ancient Slavic Mythology ‚ú™ Pagan Art and Symbols ‚ú™ Epic Metal Music,"Slavic mythology is the mythological aspect of the polytheistic religion that was practised by the Slavs before Christianisation.

The religion possesses many common traits with other religions descended from the Proto-Indo-European religion.

Unlike Greek or Egyptian mythology, there are no first-hand records for the study of Slavic mythology. Despite some arguable theories (for instance, the Book of Veles), it cannot be proven that the Slavs had any sort of writing system before Christianisation; therefore, all their original religious beliefs and traditions were likely passed down orally over the generations, and basically forgotten over the centuries following the arrival of Christianity. Before that, sparse records of Slavic religion were mostly written by non-Slavic Christian missionaries who were uninterested in accurately portraying pagan beliefs. Archaeological remains of old Slavic Cult images and shrines have been found, though little can be yielded from them without legitimate knowledge of their contexts, other than confirming existing historical records. Fragments of old mythological beliefs and pagan festivals survive up to this day in folk customs, songs, and stories of all the Slavic nations.

Folk celebrations of various Christian festivals and popular beliefs in various saints. It is, for instance, quite clear that a popular saint in many Slavic countries, St Elijah the Thunderer, is a replacement of old thunder-god Perun. Likewise, traces of ancient deities can also be found in cults of many other saints, such as St Mary, St Vitus, St George, St Blaise and St Nicholas, and it is also obvious that various folk celebrations, such as the spring feast of Jare or Jurjevo and the summer feast of Ivanje or Ivan Kupala, both very loosely associated with Christian holidays, are abundant with pre-Christian elements. These beliefs have considerable religious and sacral significance to the people still performing them. The problem is, of course, that the elements of pre-Christian religion are hopelessly mixed into popular Christianity.

There was a large spring festival dedicated to Jarilo, god of vegetation and fertility. Processions of young men or girls used to go round villages on this day, carrying green branches or flowers as symbols of new life. They would travel from home to home, reciting certain songs and bless each household with traditional fertility rites. The leader of the procession, usually riding on a horse, would be identified with Jarilo. The custom of creating pisanki or decorated eggs, also symbols of new life, was another tradition associated with this feast, which was later passed on to Christian Easter.

For the last few decades, Slavic paganism has gained limited popularity among the Russian public, with many web sites and organizations dedicated to the study of Slavic mythology[1][2] and some who openly call for ""returning to the roots.""[3]

Some musicians are also influenced by paganism, such as pagan metal band Arkona.

Most of the neopagan movements take place in Russia and Belarus, but they also take place in other Slavic countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Slovakia, Poland, Croatia and Ukraine.",Art and Music

NZNElbAP9_E,"‚ñåThe #1 Type of Food For Increasing Your Libido, Sex Drive &amp; Testosterone Levels‚ñê","A simple, yet scientifically proven way of boosting your testosterone and increasing your sex drive naturally...
‚ñ∫‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ http://drsam.co/yt/BoostYourTestosteroneNaturally

===============================================
The #1 Type of Food For Increasing Your Libido, Sex Drive & Testosterone Levels
===============================================
Today I‚Äôm going to simplify the topic of increasing your ‚Äúsex drive & libido‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm going to clarify all the silly misunderstandings about this important subject.

I would say that 95% of the information you hear about this topic -- online, articles, blogs, youtube and so forth --- it's ALL WRONG!

These so called ‚Äòexperts‚Äô list foods such as ‚Äúspecial‚Äù fruits or vegetables that have lots of good vitamins.

Or spicy foods or alcohol because they may increase your blood flow.

Or beans or meat because they have healthy protein.

Or whole grains because they have fiber and help with weight loss.

It‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äústuff‚Äù that *may* help a LITTLE‚Ä¶

 but they NEVER address the REAL problem and CAUSE of low libido, 

which is a HORMONAL IMBALANCE!

That‚Äôs it!

If your sex drive and libido isn‚Äôt where you‚Äôd like it to be or where it used to be.

If you have a hard time getting or maintaining an erection.

If you‚Äôre just not ‚Äúdriven‚Äù -- mentally, physically  or emotionally -- when it comes to sex or just life in general.

Then the problem is hormonal imbalance which typically means:
LESS ‚Äúpro-sexual‚Äù hormones - such as testosterone.
MORE ‚Äúanti-sexual‚Äù hormones - such as estrogen, prolactin and cortisol

So let‚Äôs increase the good and decrease the bad.

EAT FAT!

The best type of food that increases testosterone is FAT and more specifically, saturated fats and cholesterol.

Now, you might be freaking out and think ‚Äúokay Dr. Sam -- you‚Äôre insane!!! My cholesterol is going to go through the roof and I‚Äôm going to have a heart attack!‚Äù

Nope, not true.

First of all, over 80% of the cholesterol found in your blood and arteries is NOT from foods you eat -- but produced from your LIVER! (1)

Cholesterol and saturated fats help produce most of your sex hormones - especially testosterone.

Cholesterol helps lower your stress hormone, cortisol -- which does the OPPOSITE of testosterone.

In fact, without cholesterol you‚Äôd die eventually.

And for those of you are are really concerned about having high cholesterol -- the PRIMARY cause of high cholesterol is AGING and the change in your hormones!!!

This is why the older you get, the worse your cholesterol levels.

This is why women who go through menopause start having high cholesterol.

Again, it all comes down to a hormonal imbalance!!!

What MATTERS is WHERE you get your fats.

Don‚Äôt go fry up some bacon and think this is healthy.

Most animal and dairy fats are the problem.

Heating oils, processed vegetable fats, hydrogenated and trans fats are the problem.

Instead, have HEALTHY fats.

Have free range eggs WITH the yolk. 

The BEST way to eat eggs are RAW --- but if you can‚Äôt do that, at least keep the yolk runny and soft, which will increase your ‚Äúgood‚Äù HDL cholesterol.(2)

If you want to have some free range, grass fed meat or bison/buffalo 2-3x a week, that‚Äôs fine too.

Grass fed red meat has higher levels of CLA fats, which boost testosterone, reduce cortisol, are anti-inflammatory and help reduce many forms of cancer (4)

Other than that, I would stay away from most other meats because they‚Äôre processed and full of negative hormones such as ESTROGEN, which will LOWER your testosterone and libido.

Lastly, have some HEALTHY saturated fats and one of the best is raw, extra virgin coconut oil.

Not only does raw coconut oil improve your testosterone and fat-burning hormones, it also helps increase blood flow and circulation -- both of which are important for your sex drive and erections.(3)

The 2018 ARC/ORNL Summer Institute participants include 13 high school teachers and 36 high school students. These 49 participants are from 10 states within the Appalachian region, and are chaperoned by four Resident Teachers. The 2018 participants are distributed into 10 research teams: four of the research teams are comprised of teachers, and six teams are comprised of students. 

The ARC/ORNL Summer Institute is administered for ARC by ORAU and culminates with group presentations by students and teachers about their projects and research findings. The goals of the ARC program are to: 

*  Encourage more high school students to continue their studies beyond high school; 
*  Encourage more students to pursue careers in the projected shortage areas of science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM); and, 
*  Raise the quality of STEM instruction in high schools throughout the region. Progress in each of these three areas provides economic benefits to the Appalachian region. 

In addition to research, many other activities are incorporated into the program to promote teamwork, expose students to college opportunities, and promote pride in the cultural richness and historical importance of the Appalachian region. 

An overview of the ARC, ORNL and ORAU and their respective goals and activities can be found at:

daVaEoF5Hrk,Arnold Sch√∂nberg - Wassily Kandinsky: Music and Art Get One,"The early years of the 20th Century signed a terrific advance in the Physical Sciences. The Special (1905) and General (1916)  Theories of Relativity and the advent of Quantum Mechanics (1926) changed our lives profoundly. Around the same years, a similar revolution took place in both Music and Art. The year 1909 marks a decisive break with tonality (the structure of classical music) by Arnold Sch√∂nberg in his ""Three Piano Pieces"". The term 'Atonality' is commonly used to express this new type of composition. Wassily Kandinsky is credited with painting the first 'purely abstract' works. His production is vast and I could only include 20 of his works here, selected from a period of time that overlaps with the musical pieces by Sch√∂nberg presented in this video. They knew each other and have possibly influenced their works reciprocally. The video is an attempt to evince this intriguing 'connection' between music and painting.


About Arnold Sch√∂nberg (1874-1951):
...The final piece (of the Three Piano Pieces, Op.11) breaks through all constraints of traditional language or structure, cutting abruptly from extremes of eruptive power, as in the massively congested opening, to the most intense introspection. Perhaps Schoenberg had in mind Kandinsky, with whom he had close  contacts, when he likened such music to developments in painting -""without architecture... an ever-changing, unbroken succession of colours, rhythms and moods."" (From a Text by Peter Hill).

About Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944):
...As the ""Der Blaue Reiter""(*) Almanac essays and theorizing with composer Arnold Sch√∂nberg indicate, Kandinsky also expressed the communion between artist and viewer as being available to both the senses and the mind (Synesthesia). Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorized that, for instance, yellow is the colour of middle C on a brassy trumpet; black is the colour of closure, and the end of things; and that combinations of colours produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano. Kandinsky also developed a theory of geometric figures and their relationships, claiming, for example, that the circle is the most peaceful shape and represents the human soul.  (From Wikipedia).

Note Added: (*) Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) was a group of artists from the Neue √ºnstlervereinigung M√ºnchen in Munich, Germany. The group was founded by a number of Russian emigrants, including Wassily Kandinsky, Alexej von Jawlensky, Marianne von Werefkin, and native German artists, such as Franz Marc, August Macke and Gabriele M√ºnter. Der Blaue Reiter was a movement lasting from 1911 to 1914, fundamental to Expressionism, along with Die Br√ºcke which was founded in 1905.

lyrics:
Lyrics: Caravanserai


A gentle breeze or lightning..This glancing life is like a morning star..
A setting sun, or rolling waves at sea in a storm..
A dancing dream of all eternity..

The sand was shimmering in the morning light
And dancing off the dunes so far away..
The night held music so sweet, so long
And there we lay until the break of day..

We woke that morning at the onward call
Our camels bridled up, our howdahs full
The sun was rising in the eastern sky..
Just as we set out to the desert's cry

Calling, yearning, pulling, home to you..

The tents grew smaller as we rode away..
On earth that tells of many passing days..
The months of peace and all the years of war
The lives of love and all the lives of fears..

Calling, yearning, pulling, home to you...

We crossed the river beds all etched in stone
And up the mighty mountains ever known
Beyond the valleys in the searing heat
Until we reached the caravanserai...

Calling, yearning, pulling, home to you
Calling, yearning, pulling, home to you...

What is this life that pulls me far away..
What is that home where we cannot reside..
What is that quest that pulls me onward
My heart is full when you are by my side...

Calling, yearning, pulling, home to you....",Art and Music

Where dips the rocky mountains,
To a soft and winter lake,
There lies a frosty island,
Where flapping herons wake.
With the sound of soothing rhyme,
Let me sing for you a time,
Of a world so far it seems,
Can be only found in dreams.

CHORUS:
Come away, O human child,
To the beauties of the wild,
Where your sorrows melt away,
For the worlds more full of weeping,
Than ye can understand.

As the waves of moonlight beckon,
For you to join me there.
As the soft, white jasmine petals,
Drift through the snowy air,
As the sounds of silence cease,
The melody of rest brings peace,
As the purring lions dance,
In the winter-tide brilliance,
As the sky above us glows.
And no more our troubles find us,
In this land that's free of woes.

CHORUS

Where the wandering waters fountain,
In the pools across the dale,
You can eye the reindeer prancing,
To their long forgotten tales.
As they leap and jump and bound,
Our hearts beat to the sound,
Under frosted, ivory sky,
With their sparkling antlers high,
Their hoof-beats serenade,
As we ride across the glade,
Through the silvery, silken snow,
In a wintry wonderland,
With the brisk wind at our backs.
Let me take you there...

CHORUS

As you close your eyes in slumber,
May you take me by the hand.
Let us go where joy and laughter,
Ne'r cease in that fair land.",Art and Music

HysDgonGMCI,Art and Music are Antidotes to Intolerance: Shubha Mudgal,"Shubha Mudgal, noted composer and singer of Hindustani classical music as well as an archivist of enterprises, has launched initiatives like www.sangeetkosh.net and www.underscorerecords.com with partner Aneesh Pradhan. Most of all a voice of resistance and protest, Shubha speaks to Communalism Combat about her personal journey. As a young student who grew up in the rich cultural and academic milieu of Allahabad, Shubha began with kathak dancing, worked as a broadcaster with All India Radio and from the proceeds of her hard earned work bought her first tanpura.  Shubha then trained in Hindustani classical music under Pandit Ramashreya Jha in Allahabad, later Pandit Vinay Chandra Maudgalya in Delhi.

In this free-wheeling conversation with Teesta Setalvad, she speaks of the rich values of diversity that the Hindustani music and arts culture encapsulates, also recalling wonderful anecdotes of how leaders of the national movement like Nehru and Gandhi involved a vast array of Indians, including less visible citizens to participate in the ousting of British rule.

Keen on art and music education being introduced to Indian children at a young age, she recounts how her own personal experience of these rich and diverse worlds opened doors of the mind and heart. ‚ÄòArt and music are antidotes to intolerance‚Äô says Shubha, firmly endorsing the strong creative protests across the length and breadth of the country.

Shubha Mudgal is a regular part of SAHMAT‚Äôs January 1 celebrations every year. She speaks of the transformative experience of performing there. SAHMAT was formed after the brutal killing of Safdar Hashmi twenty-six years ago. On January 1, 1989, 34 year old Safdar Hashmi, poet, playwright and political activist with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) was beaten up by hoodlums belonging to the Congress party led by Mukesh Sharma while attempting to stage a play at Jhandapur in Sahibabad. He died from his injuries the next day. SAHMAT soon emerged as a strong artist and academic collective against the voices of authoritarianism and communalism.

On February 27, 2012, Shubha Mudgal performed at Gulberg Society as part of the tenth memorial of the Gujarat genocide. Her stage was the roof of a house where 19 people were killed. Those that soaked up the renderings of Shubha, Aneesh Pradhan and Sudhir Patwardhan were over 1,000 survivors of the pogrom from all over Gujarat along with human rights defenders.

She ends with the vocal rendering of Sahir Ludhianvi, ‚ÄúAao koi khwaab bune kal ke waste‚Ä¶‚Äù

The first image is of my first completed art project for my Drawing 1 class, which turns out to be quite a bit more than that.  The materials I used  are coffee stain, ink, charcoal pencils and conte crayons.  

The video following is a lecture on how to harmonize a melody with a I V7 expanding progression from my classical Music Theory II class.  It involves the study of solfege.  First we transcribe by ear from my teacher's playing of the bass and melody on the piano. Then, with his help, we arrange it for four voices according to the rules of the common practice as shown in the video.  Sorry about the shaky camera. I kept reaching for my pencil and trying to take notes at the same time.  Old habits die hard.",Art and Music

ZBaPihciLdU,ART IN FUSION TV - POP ART AND POP MUSIC EXHIBITION 2018 BY JORDI CASALS,"VISIT THE AMAZING POP ART AND POP MUSIC EXHIBITION IN BORMES LES MIMOSAS _ SOUTH OF FRANCE.



This exhibition , orchestrated by the  Collector Jordi Casals ,Will present from 350 to 400 items (parts,plays) of Collection representing the links between the Pop art and the Pop Music.
Bormes Mimosas will pay a vibrant tribute to the artists, painters and sculptors of the ‚Äúpop culture‚Äù
The museum will show many rare items in ‚Äúlimited edition‚Äù, the main attraction being the clone sculpture of Michael Jackson ‚Äúthe king of pop‚Äù created by Jean-Baptiste Seckler and Adrien Saada. 
The walls of the museum will be covered with old issues of iconic magazines like ""Times"", ""Look"", ""Rolling Stones"", ""Paris
Match"", ""Beaux Arts"", ""Interview""...
More than 200 pictures ,engraving, lithography‚Äôs , screen-printing‚Äôs and paintings from the main artists of the 60‚Äô and 80‚Äô,like Erro, will give the beat to this very Pop exhibition.
The exhibition will show the different faces, aspects of the artists who influenced and immortalized this era.
The visitors will be ‚Äúrocked‚Äù through the heartbeat of this singular exhibition with the music and the videos that will be played in the museum, creating this ‚Äúpop‚Äù feeling.
Encart : This event celebrates the 90th anniversary of Andy Warhol's birth, the 60th anniversary of Michael Jackson's birth as well as the 50th anniversary of May, 1968.
P O P A R T & P O P M U S I C
Two sides of the same coin
For the first time the link between pop art and pop music will be demonstrate in the museum of arts and history of Bormes les mimosas.
The exhibition evolves around three great ‚Äúheroes‚Äùof the pop culture .
Andy Warhol, Salvador Dali and Michael Jackson had many common points.
They had their own magazines and did the cover for ‚ÄúTime magazine‚Äù or Playboy.
These three artists are considered like kings or popes in the field of music and arts, they have their own wax statues in ‚Äúle mus√©e Gr√©vin‚Äù,their own fragrances, stamps and they have also played in TV commercials
The legacy that  Michael Jackson, Andy Warhol et Salvador Dali have left behind is outstanding.
The museum will show during the ‚Äú Pop art & Pop music‚Äù exhibition , a huge amount of photos and pictures , like witnesses of this great heritage
Dali, a reference for Michael Jackson
Everybody knows that Dali is the creator of self-promotion , Thanks to his unusual behavior, he was always in the center of journalists' attention, and the relations with media were the important part of the artist`s self-branding. These surrealistic happenings have inspired most of the great show business artists.
So, for the first time in France the connection , the similitude and the influence that Dali had upon Jackson will be shown.
Both geniuses have suffered from the same kind of curse , the feeling of being the substitute of their born dead older brother . Effectively , after the death of a previous child , Dali‚Äôs and Jackson‚Äôs parents have decided to make another one immediately , a heavy burden to carry for the young Salvador and Michael.
Dali, all along his life, talked about this trauma , which led him to this constant need of being different, of being the main attraction.
Michael Jackson , though performing in a different field of art , walked the same kind of path, and also had this need to be different, even from his own brothers , this need to lead his own life and career away from ‚Äúthe Jackson five‚Äù.

eEVOAhCEL5c,Art of Rene Magritte- Psychological surrealism (music-ENIGMA),"Ren√© Fran√ßois Ghislain Magritte (November 21, 1898 -- August 15, 1967) was a Belgian surrealist artist.

Magritte was born in Lessines, Belgium in 1898, the eldest son of L√©opold Magritte, a tailor, and Adeline, a milliner. He began drawing lessons in 1910. In 1912, his mother committed suicide by drowning herself in the River Sambre. Magritte was present when her body was retrieved from the water. The image of his mother floating, her dress obscuring her face, may have influenced a 1927-1928 series of paintings of people with cloth obscuring their faces, including Les Amant, but Magritte disliked this explanation. He studied at the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels for two years until 1918. In 1922 he married Georgette Berger, whom he had met in 1913.
Magritte worked in a wallpaper factory, and was a poster and advertisement designer until 1926 when a contract with Galerie la Centaure in Brussels made it possible for him to paint full-time. In 1926, Magritte produced his first surreal painting, The Lost Jockey (Le jockey perdu), and held his first exhibition in Brussels in 1927. Critics heaped abuse on the exhibition. Depressed by the failure, he moved to Paris where he became friends with Andr√© Breton, and became involved in the surrealist group.

When Galerie la Centaure closed and the contract income ended, he returned to Brussels and worked in advertising. Then, with his brother, he formed an agency, which earned him a living wage.

During the German occupation of Belgium in World War II he remained in Brussels, which led to a break with Breton. At the time he renounced the violence and pessimism of his earlier work, though he returned to the themes later.

His work showed in the United States in New York in 1936 and again in that city in two retrospective exhibitions, one at the Museum of Modern Art in 1965, and the other at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1992.

Magritte died of pancreatic cancer on August 15, 1967 and was interred in Schaarbeek Cemetery, Brussels.

Popular interest in Magritte's work rose considerably in the 1960s, and his imagery has influenced Pop, Minimalist, and Conceptual art.In 2005 he came 9th in the Walloon version of De Grootste Belg (The Greatest Belgian); in the Flemish version he was 18th.

A consummate technician, his work frequently displays a juxtaposition of ordinary objects in an unusual context, giving new meanings to familiar things. The representational use of objects as other than what they seem is typified in his painting, The Treachery of Images (La trahison des images), which shows a pipe that looks as though it is a model for a tobacco store advertisement. Magritte painted below the pipe, This is not a pipe (Ceci n'est pas une pipe), which seems a contradiction, but is actually true: the painting is not a pipe, it is an image of a pipe. (In his book, This Is Not a Pipe, French critic Michel Foucault discusses the painting and its paradox.)

Magritte pulled the same stunt in a painting of an apple: he painted the fruit realistically and then used an internal caption or framing device to deny that the item was an apple. In these Ceci n'est pas works, Magritte points out that no matter how closely, through realism-art, we come to depicting an item accurately, we never do catch the item itself: we cannot smoke tobacco with a picture of a pipe.

His art shows a more representational style of surrealism compared to the ""automatic"" style seen in works by artists like Joan Mir√≥. In addition to fantastic elements, his work is often witty and amusing. He also created a number of surrealist versions of other famous paintings.

Ren√© Magritte described his paintings by saying, ""My painting is visible images which conceal nothing; they evoke mystery and, indeed, when one sees one of my pictures, one asks oneself this simple question, 'What does that mean?'. It does not mean anything, because mystery means nothing either, it is unknowable. """,Art and Music

2MhjkAbF00U,Art x Music: Sound artist Haroon Mirza and Dave Maclean (Django Django),"Sound artist Haroon Mirza discusses the relationship between fine art and electronic music with Dave Maclean, the drummer and producer of indie band Django Django who has recently remixed Mirza's sound works under the moniker of Jellyman to create a dancefloor track that has been released by The Vinyl Factory.

Alongside Factory Floor who also reworked Mirza's experiments for release by The Vinyl Factory, Jellyman's remix explores the liminal space between art and music, which both Maclean and Mirza believe is more a matter of context than classification. 

Riffing on similar themes during this revealing conversation, Dave and Haroon discuss the role of musicians in gallery spaces, the aesthetics of Kraftwerk and Detroit techno and the ways in which Haroon's turntable experiments reflect a broader trend in DIY DJ culture to doctor and modify records to create live loops and samples.

Factory activity in New York state hit a nearly two-year low this month, offering further evidence of a sharp slowdown in economic growth. Federal officials are scheduled to meet next Tuesday and Wednesday to assess the economy. The economy is reportedly losing steam as the stimulus from last year‚Äôs $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades. One economist said, ""The economy is spinning its wheels and not gaining any traction yet.""

sqCbYd8O8MU,Audi Smart Factory - Future of Audi Production,"Audi Smart Factory P-Tech Day. Subscribe.
Audi is making its production fit for the future with the smart factory. In this factory of the future, big data ‚Äì the creation and intelligent connection of large volumes of data ‚Äì will facilitate data‚Äëdriven and thus highly flexible and highly efficient manufacturing. A method of production in which Audi might no longer build its cars on an assembly line but according to a radically new, disruptive concept is modular assembly. In addition to this major project, Audi is pursuing many other exciting projects for the production of the future ‚Äì from the application of virtual‚Äëreality glasses to metal 3D printing.

Modular assembly.
The complexity of automobile production is increasing. New market needs, customer expectations and the legislative framework are increasingly requiring innovative technologies and differing vehicle versions. This means that the fixed timing of the assembly line is becoming less efficient. The more the number of derivatives and variants grows, the more difficult it becomes to master high complexity and integrate new routines into the rigid, sequential process.

Audi intends to meet this challenge and to develop a completely new principle for it: modular assembly. With this method, small, separate workstations allow highly flexible working routines ‚Äì in terms of both time and space. Between those workstations, driverless transport systems take over the transport of the car bodies as well as the parts required for production. A central computer precisely controls the driverless transport systems ‚Äì it recognizes the needs of each individual station, thus ensuring a smooth workflow.

Audi assumes that modular assembly will result in 20 percent better productivity than the assembly lines of today. It is now being applied for test purposes at the engine plant in Gy≈ër, Hungary, and application is planned in two further projects.

At present, the key principles of this innovative production system are being worked out and tested by ‚Äúarculus‚Äù ‚Äì a startup company established a few months ago.

The Technical Center for Production Assistance Systems.
The new driverless transport systems required for modular assembly are being created in Audi‚Äôs ‚ÄúTechnology Development Production Assistance Systems‚Äù department. This small department has developed two types of driverless vehicle: One of them moves under control by a computer, the other moves autonomously on a defined route. Three onboard laser scanners allow the driverless transport systems to orient themselves and to recognize and avoid potentially critical situations. Audi developed the navigation software itself. It is based on automotive software and automotive‚Äësoftware development processes.

The main task of the Technical Center for Production Assistance Systems is to work on new production technologies in early stages of their development. In addition to driverless transport systems, it is also working on four other projects. They comprise safe cooperation between humans and machines when working in the same space, assembly tables with assistance functions and two innovative robots: a flexible gripper arm and a special lightweight robot.

The Audi Production Lab.
The Audi Production Lab, abbreviated as P‚ÄëLab, develops and supports innovative projects for the production process ‚Äì often starting with the very first idea. The department currently has five permanent employees andhas already helped to bring innovations such as metal 3D printing, human‚Äërobot cooperation, driverless transport systems and the use of augmented reality at Audi towards series application.

The projects currently running in the P‚ÄëLab include two big‚Äëdata projects. One of them focuses on the early recognition of mistakes in the placement of screws and bolts; the other examines the flow of components in the area of international logistics for the CKD plants (completely knocked down). Another major subject for the Audi Production Lab is data glasses. They can provide effective support for employees in production, for the planners and engineers in the factory of the future ‚Äì with assisted reality, augmented reality and virtual reality.

Toolmaking.
Several future-oriented projects are running in Audi‚Äôs Toolmaking division. The structure of the new generation of press tools follows nature, with many parts made of aluminum and plastics. This reduces the weight of those tools, which until now has been up to 45 tons, by up to 20 percent and the energy required decreases by about ten percent. The result is enhanced precision in the forming of sheet‚Äëmetal parts.

The press shop, where the tools are applied, uses the latest measuring technology. The goal is to develop a complete data chain for each sheet‚Äëmetal part. The data chain already begins with the suppliers of steel and aluminum. This is another way in which Audi is enhancing its precision.",Manufacturing

1CN6I_Q4cpA,Australia vs USA: 20 Differences,"20 Differences between Australia and the USA.  I recently spent 2 weeks in Australia, and in many ways it seems similar to the USA, but the things that are different definitely stand out!  EXPAND DESCRIPTION FOR TABLE OF CONTENTS.  I share some of the things that I found to be most different between Australia and the USA. As an American, I had a view of Australia being like what I‚Äôve seen in the Crocodile Dundee movies‚Ä¶ and well‚Ä¶ not everybody in Australia carries a huge knife!

1 - Australian English
    Parking Lot - Car Park
    Opening Hours - Trading Hours
    Pot/Pint of Beer - Small Glass or Big Glass
    Jumper - Jacket
    lollis - hard candies
    Bloke - guy
    Mate - friend
    No worries - no problem
    Uni - University
    Maccas - Mcdonalds
    Sunnies - sunglasses
    Brekkie - breakfast
    Roo - Kangaroo
2 - Store Hours
    Stores in Australia seem to have really early closing hours
3 - Paying at restaurants
    In Australia it is often at the front of the store, not with the server
4 - Tipping
    No tipping in Australia
5 - Paper money in different sizes
    From small to big based on currency
    And there aren‚Äôt any pennies in Australia
    5 cents is the smallest coin
6 - Prices include Tax
    I quite like this one
7 - Credit card fees are Rampant
    Taxis charge extra for using a credit card
8 - Cars drive on the left instead of the right
    But people don‚Äôt seem to walk on the left instead of the right
    Sidewalk Chaos!
    No turn on red
9 - Dates are reversed
    Day then month instead of Month then Day
10 - Imperial vs Metric
    Celsius vs Fahrenheit
    Miles vs Kilometers
11 - Way more south Asian Food
    Singaporean & Malaysian food is plentiful in Australia
12 - Knife and Fork etiquette
    Australians keep their knife and the fork held all the time
13 - Coffee
    Australian coffee is espresso based
    Much stronger than American coffee
14 - Summer vs Winter
    Seasons are reversed
    I left a heat wave in California to arrive to 1 Degree C in Australia
15 - Sports
    Australians love their sports!
    Australian Rules Football - Footy - Circle Court
    Cricket!
    Multiple teams to a city
    No ‚Äòcollege‚Äô sports
16 - Australian Calendar starts on Monday
    Makes sense -- it‚Äôs the beginning of the work week
    Why does the US Calendar start on Sunday?
17 - Power outlets
    I‚Äôve never seen Australian power outlets anywhere else
18 - Much more water conscious
    Australians are taught to only take 3 minute showers
    And most toilets have 2 buttons, light flush and big flush
19 - Electric Tea Kettles
    Push a button and the water gets hot!
    No stove required!
20 - Population Size
    For about the same size as the continental US, Australia has way less people
    Australian Population: 23 Million
    USA Population: 323 Million

wmZsCc-c_X8,BeauSoleil Quartet Oral History,"Members of the BeauSoleil Quartet discussed their lives and musical careers. 

Speaker Biography: For four decades the BeauSoleil Quartet has taken traditional ingredients -- waltzes, two-steps, soulful Cajun French lyrics, hot fiddle licks and irresistible accordion -- and spiced them up with eclectic percussion, acoustic guitar in both finger-picked and flat-picked styles and an open and creative attitude toward the music. BeauSoleil was the first Cajun band to win a Grammy Award (1998) and added a second in 2008. In 2011 the quartet was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame.

The Big History series asks questions guaranteed to change the way you look at the past. 
Did Napoleon's invasion of Russia come undone because of...tin buttons?  Did New York become America's biggest city because of...salt? How does the sinking of the Titanic power your cell phone? What's the connection between ancient Egyptian mummies and a modern ham and cheese sandwich?

By weaving science into the core of the human story, Big History takes familiar subjects and gives them a twist that will have you rethinking everything from the Big Bang to today's headlines. The series creates an interconnected panorama of patterns and themes that links history to dozens of fields including astronomy, biology, chemistry, and geology.  The first season ends with a two-hour finale that pulls everything we know about science and history into one grand narrative of the universe and us.",History

J5MFY3DdMjk,Bill Aulet: Vannevar Bush Lecture Series on Science and Technology Innovation,"This is part of a lecture series during spring 2018

This lecture series, which includes imminent researchers and innovators from a wide variety of fields across MIT, will showcase the numerous forms that innovation takes and the pathways it can take from ideation to implementation. 

Summary
Between 1980 and 2005, the dominant share of the jobs created in the US were created by companies that were less than 5 years old.  Innovation-driven entrepreneurship is not just a driver of jobs and economic prosperity but it is seen as one of the most efficient and effective tools to deal with society‚Äôs intractable problems in areas like healthcare, energy, climate change, education and many other areas.  As we look forward, the challenge of how we produce more and better entrepreneurs is an important one.  MIT has been a leader in entrepreneurship education and the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship is recognized for its leading edge work in this area.  This talk will describe the approaches that have proven successful and unsuccessful and what the future looks like for ‚Äúinclusive entrepreneurship‚Äù that will go beyond the physical boundaries of MIT to educate millions in the future as opposed to thousands today.

About the Speaker
Bill Aulet is the Managing Director of the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship and Professor of the Practice at the MIT Sloan School of Management. He is changing the way entrepreneurship is understood, taught, and practiced around the world. Bill is an award-winning educator and author whose current work is built off the foundation of his 25-year successful business career first at IBM and then as a three-time serial entrepreneur. During this time, he directly raised over a hundred million dollars and, more importantly, created hundreds of millions of dollars of shareholder value through his companies. Since 2009, he has been responsible for leading the development of entrepreneurship education across MIT at the Martin Trust Center. Bill's first book, Disciplined Entrepreneurship, released in August 2013, has been translated into over 18 languages and has been the content for three online edX courses which have been taken by hundreds of thousands of people in 199 different countries. The accompanying follow-on book, Disciplined Entrepreneurship Workbook, was released in April 2017. Bill has widely published in in places such as the Wall Street Journal, TechCrunch, the Boston Globe, the Sloan Management Review, the Kauffman Foundation, Entrepreneur Magazine, MIT Sloan Experts and more. He has been a featured speaker on shows such as CNBC‚Äôs Squawk Box, BBC News, Bloomberg News as well as at events and conferences around the world.

This is the first lecture in a series over the course of spring 2018.

This lecture series, which includes imminent researchers and innovators from a wide variety of fields across MIT, will showcase the numerous forms that innovation takes and the pathways it can take from ideation to implementation. 

Title: Advanced Manufacturing - The New American Innovation Policies

Topic Summary

In 2016 the political system experienced significant disruption in part due to an angry voting block suffering from a long decline in American manufacturing, which became particularly acute in the decade of the 2000s. Manufacturing employment fell by one third in this period, 64,000 factories closed, manufacturing capital investment and output suffered, and the productivity rate dropped. The U.S. had been systematically shifting production abroad, and experts began to realize as the next decade began that the decline in its production capability was starting to affect its innovation capacity ‚Äì which had long been viewed as its core economic strength.

         The talk reviews the origins of the policy response to this dilemma, which came to be called ‚Äúadvanced manufacturing.‚Äù  It will trace the way the foundational concepts were developed in a series of reports from in and out of government.  It will explore how, for the first time, an innovation system response was considered and developed to strengthen the U.S. production system. It will examine the key new policy mechanism created by the Administration and supported by Congress, the manufacturing innovation institutes, a complex public-private collaborative model to develop new production technologies and processes, with supporting workforce education. It will review how the new institutes are working, lessons learned as they have started up and possible enhancements that could expand their policy reach.  The talk draws on the new book by Bonvillian (with Peter Singer), Advanced Manufacturing - The New American Innovation Policies just released in January by MIT Press.

About the Speaker

William B. Bonvillian is a Lecturer at MIT, and an advisor on research projects at MIT‚Äôs Office of Digital Learning and its Industrial Policy Center. From 2006 until 2017, he was director of MIT‚Äôs Washington Office, supporting MIT‚Äôs historic role in science policy. He teaches courses on innovation systems at MIT and on energy technology policy at Johns Hopkins SAIS, and is coauthor of three books on innovation, Advanced Manufacturing ‚Äì The New American Innovation Policies (MIT Press 2018), Technological Innovation in Legacy Sectors (Oxford University Press 2015) and Structuring an Energy Technology Revolution (MIT Press 2009). Previously, he worked for over 15 years on innovation issues as a senior advisor in the U.S. Senate, and earlier was a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Transportation. He serves on the National Academies of Science standing committee for its Innovation Policy Forum, chairs the Committee on Science and Engineering Policy at the American Association for the Advancement of Science and serves on the board of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, was awarded IEEE‚Äôs public service award, and has written and spoken extensively about science and technology and innovation policy issues.",Science and Technology

ZM80F_J-QHE,Bj”ßrk - Mutual Core - OFFICIAL - Art + Music - MOCAtv,"In ""Mutual Core,"" recorded by Bj√∂rk for her seventh album Biophilia, the earth's geology is a metaphor for human relationships. Eruptions and earthquakes, the building of continents, the formation of mountain ranges and oceanic trenches: all are powerful signs of the earth's structure and mechanics. Represented musically by the violent interruption of block rocking beats, video director Andrew Thomas Huang here depicts the push and pull of tectonic plates with anthropomorphized rocks, lava and sand encircling Bj√∂rk in dance, their psychedelic innards resembling the frayed strands of a Fritz Haeg rug.

Consisting of turning and adaptive milling on a Hermle C50U MT mill/turn machining centre. By combining innovative 5-axis machining strategies with conical barrel cutters (supplied by Technicut), the milling cycle time was slashed from 200 hours to 35 (a saving of 83%) or ¬£18,150 per blade. At the same time, tooling costs were reduced by 72%.

Once complete, the full blisk was polished using a Fanuc M-710iC industrial robot cell.

In this video, he elaborate on how the technology can help industries like aviation, defense and others. These industries manufacture large machinery which travel across geographies and their installation manuals need to be accessible in a number of languages. Blockchain can better manage documentation related to this complex variety of machinery and enables stakeholders to quickly access documentation and install, maintain and repair as needed. Being a trust based platform, blockcahin ensures security and traceability of sensitive documentation in the manufacturing industry as well.

Thanks to Ali and Shehroze for hosting me.

Lyari Town is one of the eighteen constituent towns of Karachi, known as Little or Mini Balochistan. Just a few years ago, Lyari was ruled by gangs, and known for its brutal violence and unrest. But recently things have changed for the better.

We wanted to visit Lyari, Karachi, for one because I didn‚Äôt have a chance to visit Balochistan on my trip to Pakistani, and for two - in our very short visit, to share a story of people, hope, and those who are making a difference.

After walking around one of the colorful neighborhoods, we jumped in a rickshaw to go find breakfast. Not totally sure where we ended up, but we found a man who was extremely friendly and hospitable and a popular place to eat breakfast.

His food scooping skills were impressive!

The food was delicious, and the entire experience was memorable and rewarding.

YyrR9EwhFcQ,Brexit Impact on Manufacturing | Womble Bond Dickinson,"Hear from Womble Bond Dickinson's Malcolm Dowden on what impact Brexit could have on the manufacturing business.

Transcript:
 Another sector that is under urgent pressure to adapt to Brexit is the manufacturing sector.  And a particular problem for manufacturing is that current production methods, current distribution of the stages of production, are very largely based on the EU single market.  We quite commonly for example see automobile manufacturers having parts of a vehicle built in one EU jurisdiction, other stages of the process are being carried out elsewhere in the EU finishing yet in another jurisdiction and then the finished product being distributed as a part of the single market through the EU.  Post-Brexit that integrated manufacturing process has to be rethought.  And it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that those processes can‚Äôt carry on in the locations that are currently used.  It does mean, however, that we as advisors need to need to help clients to have a much clearer view of the specific reliefs facilitations and other measures that they should be applying for.  For example, tariff impacts customs beauties can be mitigated or eliminated by applying for reliefs like inward processing relief.  We are working with clients and governmental authorities in the UK to explore the potential for structures like free ports or free zones to address those sectoral impacts.  And we‚Äôre even looking with parts of UK government revenue and customs in particular at the scope for developing technology based virtual free zones that would allow elements of the manufacturing process to be traced through the process rather than being looked at on a geographical basis.  So customs facilitations and reliefs would apply as long as those components are verifiably within the same production lines and production process rather than applying only because they are within a defined geographic free zone.  Now that‚Äôs a live discussion and it‚Äôs also something that‚Äôs driving some innovative and creative investment which I think is a useful indication that Brexit as well as being a challenge can also be an accelerator.  It can be an impulse for innovation.  So I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs all doom and gloom, particularly not for the manufacturing sector which has in any event been making huge strides in terms of the adoption of inter matter things technology, block change distributor ledger, and other related innovations.  So that‚Äôs where I think the manufacturing sectors focus of attention should be and in fact is.",Manufacturing

5CHtEASlzG8,Bruce Conner - BREAKAWAY - Art + Music - MOCAtv,"Dennis Hopper has described the experience of seeing Bruce Conner's A MOVIE (1958) like lifting the veil from his eyes, an associative blur of images that would go on to influence the infamous acid trip scene in his film Easy Rider. Years later, Hopper recalls, he and Dean Stockwell held the lights for Conner as he filmed Toni Basil dancing for BREAKAWAY (1966), the short film set to her song of the same name. A rare example of a Bruce Conner musical film containing all original photography, what makes the film unquestionably Conner is his frenetic editing and the evanescence of his subject, a spirit flickering in celluloid. The flashes of figure would reappear in Conner's sculptural photograms such as ""Sound of Two Hand Angel"" (1974).

W7bfwdzv9BA,Bruce Conner - MONGOLOID - Art + Music - MOCAtv,"It may have been an unusual sight‚Äîan elder statesmen from the Beat Generation hanging out at Mabuhay Gardens at the height of punk, taking pictures of bands like Negative Trend and slam dancing with teenagers. But Bruce Conner was restless and the energy of punk invigorated him. For MONGOLOID (1978), the short film Conner began preparing after seeing Devo on their first tour, Conner spliced together newsreel, educational, and b-movie footage which resonated with their satirical lyrics about an underdeveloped man-child determined to fit into and positively contribute to mainstream American society. Gerald Casale discusses meeting Conner in Los Angeles and finding political and aesthetic common ground with Dada and Constructivism.

RheSKxNyOL8,"Burning Man 2017: 70,000-strong expected to attend desert art and music festival - TomoNews","BLACK ROCK DESERT, NEVADA ‚Äî The Burning Man festival is here once again as hipsters from across the country start to litter the deserts of Nevada to play in the sand and use some dust. 

The no-holds-barred art and music festival parties on for nine straight days until September 4. About 70,000 people are expected to show up this year. 

Tickets are an ultra-affordable $1,200. Burning Manners also have to get to Black Rock Desert by themselves. 

Smoking Man is billed as a festival full of eclectic artists, off-the-wall families, high power CEO douches and tech dweebs. 

Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg have all partied it up at Hot Man before. Wouldn't you totally want to do some lines with these guys? 
The Smoldering Man was first held by Larry Harvey and some pals in 1986. 

It's called Burning Man because it started with some hippies chanting around a bonfire on the summer solstice on Baker Beach in San Fran. 

Since then, it's blown up into the spectacle you see now today. At the end of the festival, all the hipsters get together and burn a giant wooden man. It's so touching ‚Äî especially if you're as high as a Space-X rocket.

lDnnT5l3hHk,"Camille Paglia: Art and American Culture, Essays, History, Film, Music - Speech","Camille Anna Paglia (English: /Ààp…ëÀêli…ô/; born April 2, 1947) is an American academic and social critic. Paglia has been a professor at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, since 1984.

Paglia is critical of the influence modern French writers have had on the humanities, claiming that universities are in the ""thrall"" of French post-structuralists;[57] that in the works of Jean Baudrillard, Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan and Michel Foucault, she never once found a sentence that interested her;[58] and that post-structuralism has broken the link between the word and the thing, and thus endangers the Western canon.[59] Fran√ßois Cusset writes that Paglia, like other major American public intellectuals after World War II, owes her broader recognition mainly to the political repercussions of polemics that first erupted on college campuses, in her case to a polemic against foreign intellectualism. He says she achieved phenomenal success when she called Foucault a ""bastard"", thereby providing (together with Alan Sokal's Social Text parody) the best evidence for Paul de Man's view that theory should be defined negatively, based on the opposition it arouses.[60] However, Paglia's assessment of French writers is not purely negative. She has called Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex (1949) ""brilliant"", and identified Jean-Paul Sartre's work as part of a high period in literature. Paglia has praised Roland Barthes' Mythologies (1957) and Gilles Deleuze's Masochism: Coldness and Cruelty (1967), while finding both men's later work flawed. Of Gaston Bachelard, who influenced Paglia, she wrote ""[his] dignified yet fluid phenomenological descriptive method seemed to me ideal for art"", adding that he was ""the last modern French writer I took seriously"".

Stops along the way include the rise of industrial capitalism, mass production, disgruntled workers, Karl Marx, and the Socialist Beard.

Capoeira is a Brazilian martial art that combines elements of dance and music. It was created in Brazil mainly by descendants of African slaves with Brazilian native influences, probably beginning in the 16th century. It is known by quick and complex moves, using mainly power, speed, and leverage for leg sweeps.
The word capoeira probably comes from Tupi, referring to the areas of low vegetation in the Brazilian interior.

MANUFACURE OF PORTLAND CEMENT:Raw Materials: The raw materials required for cement manufacture are. Lime stone which provides calcium. Clay which provides aluminium and silica.Cement is manufactured by two methods they are. Wet process. Dry process. Now let us discuss wet process and dry process detailed.WET PROCESS:In the wet process, first the clay is purified by washing in a wash mill.The lime stone is crushed into small particles and mixed with purified clay in proper proportions to get raw slurry.DRY PROCESS: In the dry process the raw materials are mixed in proper proportions.The mixture is dried, pulverized (Crushed into fine particles) and made uniform. The resulting powder is called ""raw material"".The raw slurry or raw meal, obtained by one of wet or dry process called charge. Charge is introduced into a rotary Kiln.The rotary kiln consists of a steel cylinder about 150meters long and 4meter diameter and rotates 30 to 60 turns per hour.At one end of the cylinder a screw conveyer is arranged which slowly allows the charge into the cylinder.The other end of the cylinder, a burneris arranged coal or burning oil is burnt at this end.The charge entering the cylinder slowly moves towards the hot end.At the burning end of the kiln, the temperature is around 1700 to 1900degrees centigrade, at this end some chemical reactions takes place between calcium oxide and aluminium silicates.Mixture of calcium silicates and calcium aluminates is formed.The resultant product consists of gray hard balls called clinker cement.Clinker cement is cooled, ground to fine powder and mixed with 2 to 3 percent of gypsum.",Manufacturing

If you love spicy Sichuan food and street food in China, then you're going to love Dan Dan noodles, because they are so flavorful and covered in a rich chili oil!

In this Chinese street food video, we're bringing you on a full on Dan Dan noodle tour of Chengdu, China, DEEP in the heart of Sichuan in Southwest China. This is the land of delicious and spicy Sichuan cuisine, sometimes spelled Szechuan cuisine. There are so many famous Sichuan foods to try here in Chengdu, but today, we are trying 4 different variations of Dan Dan noodles, also sometimes called Zajiang noodles.

China has so many amazing street foods to try, and I've been filming and documenting them for you for the past 4 years. In my opinion, the best noodle dish in China is dan dan noodles, right here in Chengdu, Sichuan. China has some of the best street food around the world, and these dan dan noodles were INSANELY GOOD, some of the best noodles in China for sure!

If you're traveling to China to eat and try different street foods, and perhaps want to learn a little bit about Chinese food and chinese cooking in the process, you need to try a few different variations of Dan Dan noodles. When they prepare the traditional Chinese dan dan noodle recipe right on the street, you can watch as they scoop the main ingredients like chili oil, soy sauce, sichuan peppercorn, and garlic right into the noodle bowl and then place the steaming hot noodles right over top. It's truly satisfying! After they put the noodles over top, they place their signature fried ground pork on top, known in Chinese as shaozi. 

When your dan dan noodles arrive to your table, it is very important to mix up all the chili oil and all of the ingredients throughout. This ensures that the flavour and the hot oil gets coated onto each noodle before you take a bite. It's also quite satisfying mixing the noodles and watching the dark red oil slowly turn each noodle from white into red and silky smooth. 

When you take your first bite, you'll understand why this is one of the BEST Chinese street foods you need to try. The spicy noodles are coated with an incredibly aromatic chili oil and really send you straight up to heaven! It's one of the best forms of Chinese cooking!

MUy8Xf3_AtA,Chinese Street Food HOT POT HEAVEN + RABBIT Noodles and SPICY Dumplings in China - CHILI OIL 4 LIFE!,"Chinese Street Food in Chengdu, China is the BEST in the WORLD! 
‚ñ∫ BRAND NEW Chili Oil 4 Life Merch here:  https://www.thefoodranger.com/Chilioil4life

In this Chinese street food tour of Chengdu, China, we're bringing you to eat at 4 classic Chengdu foods. Chinese cooking is some of the best in the world, and in Chengdu, China, the cuisine is world famously known as Sichuan cuisine or Szechuan cuisine. It is spicy and numbing and covered in delicious Chili oil. I moved here to Chengdu specifically to be able to eat spicy and delicious Chinese street foods. 

‚ñ∫For addresses a full Chengdu Food Tour, visit my blog post on Chengdu street food, it has a huge list of the best street foods to try in Chengdu, China. The Chengdu food guide features all of the locations within this Chinese street food video: ‚ñ∫https://www.thefoodranger.com/the-ultimate-chengdu-food-tour/

In this Chinese street food tour video, we're starting out with one of China's most famous foods; DUMPLINGS. In Chengdu, they are different from the rest of China. Here, they are boiled and covered in a thick and spicy chili oil that leaves you so SATISFIED! These are some of the most satisfying dumplings ever! I must admit though, the filling could have been more plump. If you are traveling to Chengdu to eat Szechuan cuisine, I would personally recommend trying the red chili oil wontons first. 

And after those amazing dumplings in Chengdu, we're eating another famous dish in Sichuan cuisine, RABBIT. Eating rabbit is very famous in Sichuan, and here in Chengdu, locals love it in a numbing and spicy Szechuan Sauce. But we wanted to try a more UNIQUE style of eating rabbit in Sichuan, on top of noodles. So we visited a local rabbit noodle joint and ate a couple unique bowls of Chinese Sichuan noodles. The first was the rabbit noodles, where the rabbit is served to you in thin slices covered in chilies, ginger, and onions. You then pour it over top of your thick and spicy chili oil broth noodle bowl. It was absolutely delicious. The next bowl of spicy noodles that we ordered was the beef noodle soup - red braised beef noodle soup. Super delicious and spicy!

After eating those 2 bowls of delicious Sichuan noodles, we are bringing you to a nice original fly restaurant of Chengdu, Mingting fandian. The fly restaurants of Chengdu are old locations that are sometimes less than cleanly but have incredible food! Nowadays most fly restaurants in Chengdu are actually really clean and you don't have to worry about getting sick from eating the street food. At mingting restaurant, we ordered a river carp,  spicy pork blood, spare ribs, fried sticky rice strips, Sichuan sausages, twice cooked pork, and pig brain tofu. It was all incredibly delicious!

And for our final meal in this Chinese street food tour of Chengdu, China, we're going for one of the most famous foods to try in Sichuan, HOT POT! We found a local 9 section hot pot that serves spicy and delicious hot pot and is always busy! For detailed addresses to these restaurants and street foods, make sure to visit my full Chinese food guide to Chengdu, China:

I wasn't born last night
I know these hoes ain't right
But you was blowing up her phone last night
But she ain't have her ringer nor her ring on last night, oh
Nigga, that's that nerve
Why give a bitch your heart
When she rather have a purse?
Why give a bitch your inch
When she rather have nine?
You know how the game goes
She be mine by half time, I'm the shit, oh
Nigga, that's that nerve
You all about her, and she all about hers
Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos
And I done did everything but trust these hoes
(CB fuck with me!)

When a rich nigga want you
And yournigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see""",Art and Music

In which John Green teaches you about the early days of the Civil Rights movement. By way of providing context for this, John also talks a bit about wider America in the 1950s. The 1950s are a deeply nostalgic period for many Americans, but there is more than a little idealizing going on here. The 1950s were a time of economic expansion, new technologies, and a growing middle class. America was becoming a suburban nation thanks to cookie-cutter housing developments like the Levittowns.  While the white working class saw their wages and status improve, the proverbial rising tide wasn't lifting all proverbial ships. A lot of people were excluded from the prosperity of the 1950s. Segregation in housing and education made for some serious inequality for African Americans. As a result, the Civil Rights movement was born. John will talk about the early careers of Martin Luther King, Thurgood Marshall, Rosa Parks, and even Earl Warren. He'll teach you about Brown v Board of Education, and the lesser known Mendez vs Westminster, the Montgomery Bus Boycott, and all kinds of other stuff.

Crash Course World History is now available on DVD! Visit http://dft.ba/-CCWHDVD to buy a set for your home or classroom.

X3Os6vJxpu0,Classic Lute - Renaissance Art | Music Collection,"Classic Lute - Renaissance Art | Music Collection

Music Player: Unknow
Image: Artemisia Gentileschi (Self-Portrait)

No Tracklist Avaiable.

In the Renaissance era, the lute was the most popular instrument in the Western world. It became the symbol of the magic and power of music. The lute was the instrument of kings and queens, playing the sublime music of great composers. The lute was heard in the theatre in the incidental music of Shakespeare's plays. And the lute was heard by common people, playing the popular tunes of the day in pubs and on street corners.

The lute is the descendent of the Arabic Oud which traveled into Europe during the time of the Crusades. From the beginning, the lute had a pear-shaped body, a rounded back made of separate strips of wood, and a bent-back pegbox.
he Early Music movement of the late twentieth century saw a new generation of lutenists dedicated to rediscovering the old performance practices. The tremendous beauty, variety and color of Renaissance and Baroque lute music can now be heard in their performances. And the amazing musical flexibility of the lute is revealed through new compositions, written in a variety of styles. After two hundred years of neglect, the future of the lute once again looks bright.

In which John Green wraps up revolutions month with what is arguably the most revolutionary of modern revolutions, the Industrial Revolution. While very few leaders were beheaded in the course of this one, it changed the lives of more people more dramatically than any of the political revolutions we've discussed. So, why did the Industrial Revolution happen around 1750 in the United Kingdom? Coal. Easily accessible coal, it turns out. All this, plus you'll finally learn the difference between James Watt and Thomas Newcomen, and will never again be caught telling people that your blender has a 900 Newcomen motor.

You've probably heard of Christopher Columbus, who ""discovered"" America in 1492, but what about Vasco da Gama? How about Zheng He? Columbus gets a bad rap from many modern historians, but it turns out he was pretty important as far as the history of the world goes. That said, he wasn't the only pioneer plying the seas in the 1400s. In Portugal, Vasco da Gama was busy integrating Europe into the Indian Ocean Trade by sailing around Africa. Chinese admiral Zheng He was also traveling far and wide in the largest wooden ships ever built. Columbus, whether portrayed as hero or villain, is usually credited as the great sailor of the 15th century, but he definitely wasn't the only contender. What better way to settle this question than with a knock-down, drag-out, no holds barred, old-fashioned battle royal? We were going to make it a cage match, but welding is EXPENSIVE.

OxI6uPQwu8I,Composer Chat 03 - Art and Music - Limitation as Freedom,"I am discussing the concept of limitation in the context of artistic freedom. When I am faced with the whiteness of my creative page, I like to set limiting parameters before I begin my work. Choosing to limit my creative output can bring focus and direction. The following are a few examples of the concept of limitation:

1. Georgia O'Keeffe uses soft and wavy curves in her paintings (example: Flower of Life II)

2. Claude Debussy focuses on the pentatonic and the octatonic scales in his compositions.

3. The game of chess limits the movements of the pieces both collectively and individually.

8EDlksmj26A,Computational History Group,"Helsinki Computational History Group (COMHIS, http://www.helsinki.fi/computational-history) is a multidisciplinary team that studies intellectual history. The work in the group is guided by methods from various different backgrounds ranging from modern data science and machine learning to history and linguistics.

The main research objective of the group is an integrated study of public discourse and knowledge production that combines metadata from library catalogues as well as full-text libraries of books, newspapers and periodicals in early modern Europe. The group implements this strategy through different projects and is currently involved, for example, in a Finnish consortium to study the development of public discourse in Finland and in an international H2020 project entitled the NewsEye. Of the various historical periods that these projects focus on, the eighteenth-century and the Enlightenment play a central role in the group‚Äôs work.

Why work on metadata?

The core methodology of COMHIS research is shaped by open data analytical ecosystems. These provide transparent and reproducible approach for historical data analysis, as well as generic algorithmic tools that can be applied also more widely in related studies.
 
In our work on metadata, we have harmonized and studied, for example, Fennica, Kungliga, Heritage of the Printed Book (by CERL) and ESTC catalogues. Within past couple year we have put particular efforts on the ESTC and are fast approaching a serious analysis phase on the publishers, edition field and authors in early modern Britain and North-America. One important objective is also to combine the ESTC metadata to full-texts of ECCO that we are also studying. It is our assumption that this will also change the way that one uses big historical data sets, such as ECCO, in text mining. This is something that regards everyone in digital humanities, so stay tuned!

Did you know?

In 2016, Helsinki Computational History Group was awarded an Open Science and Research Award by Finnish Ministry of Education.

Besides the mentioned funded projects, Helsinki Computational History Group collaborates actively with different partners from various countries and backgrounds. We are also constantly looking for new collaborators and partners, so please get in touch!",History

Williams College Professor Gage McWeeny (Ph.D., English and American Literature, Princeton University) has devoted part of his career to the study of twentieth century and contemporary, experimental, or conceptual writing and art. Using Sol LeWitt's wall drawings as a connection to conceptualism in literature, McWeeny sheds light on the writings of Andy Warhol, Kenneth Goldsmith, and others.

David Lang, Pulitzer Prize winning composer for the ""Little Match Girl Passion"" (2008) and co-founder of the musical group Bang on a Can, will also make similar connections between Sol LeWitt's art and his own conceptualist and modernist compositions, as well as the conceptual music of Steve Reich and Tom Johnson.

XCRbISUfU2Y,Convergence 2016: Electronic Music + Visual Art,"When it comes to Electronic Music + Visual Art, we have entered into a post-instrument era in which music and visual art born of technology produce contemporary, dynamic and convergent new forms. Traditional apparatus and techniques are displaced by computer based processes, virtual instruments, electronic hardware and custom machines, stems, patches, waveforms and midi. This inaugural residency welcomes artists working in rhythmic and experimental electronic music realms, digital visual artists, and those pursuing work that creates synergies between sound, music and art.

This Banff Centre residency provided the context for artists to research, conceive, prototype and present new artistic works, tools, techniques and perspectives for electronic music, sound, and visual creation. Under the artistic direction of Patti Schmidt and Jen Mizuik, and led by faculty Robin Fox and Uwe Schmidt with guest faculty who are specialists in their fields, the program offered sessions and workshops on modular synthesizers, electronic music software and hardware, visual creation software and methods, artistic process and philosophy, and the nature of live performance in these technologically dominated fields. Together artists, peers, and world-renowned faculty exchanged knowledge, discussed ideas, experimented with processes, created, collaborated, performed, and shared artistic experiences.

Artists presented their works-in-progress throughout the program. The nature of the practices involved determined the presentation format and ranged from live performances, informal presentations, installations, talks and workshops. Artists received technical and artistic guidance during the development of their projects and research. This video gives a glimpse into the coolness that was the 2016 Convergence Residency.

Yhif28t47qk,"Creativity Music for Writing, Art, Work etc. - Focus &amp; Creativity (With Binaural Beats)","Creativity Music for Writing, Art, Work etc. - Focus & Creativity (With Binaural Beats) 

MP3 DOWNLOAD: https://www.brainwavehub.com/downloads/creativity-focus-for-writing-art-work/

Using a combination of Theta, Alpha and Beta frequencies, this audio is designed to act as an aid to your creative pursuits, encourage fluid, abstract thought processes while maintaining focus over long periods. 

The Theta / Beta frequencies range from 6-7hz & 13-15hz respectively, with 8-12hz alpha waves interspersed throughout. The patterns switch in the following manner, every 5 minutes: 

0-5 mins - Alpha / Beta; 
5-10 mins - Theta / Alpha; 
10 - 15 mins -Alpha / Beta; 
etc. etc.  up to one hour. 

This quick interplay between beta and theta/alpha promotes a balance between concrete thought and creative abstraction. This way we can encourage and bring to light new insights, generate new & original ideas, contemplate a concept from various points of view, and problem solve holistically. The beta phases serve to not only promote focus and concentration, but to also analyse, organise and therefore make sense of the abstractions derived from the more non linear holistic mind states induced by Theta and Alpha. 

In addition to using this audio during work or study, you can also use it in a rested state while meditating to assist with creative visualisation. 


As binaural beats have been integrated into this track, we recommend using headphones.

JUpidCc7wwY,Dead Kennedys: Soup Is Good Food,"We're sorry
But you're no longer needed
Or wanted
Or even cared about here
Machines can do a better job than you
This is what you get for asking questions

The unions agree
'Sacrifices must be made'
Computers never go on strike
To save the working man you've got to put him out to pasture

Looks like we'll have to let you go
Doesn't it feel fulfilling to know
That you-the human being-are now obsolete
And there's nothing in hell we'll let you do about it

[Chorus]
Soup is good food-(We don't need you any more)
You made a good meal-(We don't need you any more)
Now how do you feel-(We don't need you any more)
To be shit out our ass
And thrown in the cold like a piece of trash
We're sorry
You'll just have to leave
Unemployment runs out after just six weeks
How does it feel to be a budget cut?
You're snipped
You no longer exist

Your number's been purged from our central computer
So we can rig the facts
And sweep you under the rug
See our chart? Unemployment's going down
If that ruins your life that's your problem

Soup is Good Food, Etc.
We're sorry
We hate to interrupt
But it's against the law to jump off this bridge
You'll just have to kill yourself somewhere else
A tourist might see you
And we wouldn't want that

I'm just doing my job, you know
So say uncle
And we'll take you to the mental health zoo
Force feed you mind-melting chemicals
Til even the outside world looks great

In hi-tech science research labs
It costs too much to bury all the dead
The mutilated disease-injected
Surplus rats who can't be used anymore

So they're dumped (with no minister present)
In a spiraling corkscrew dispose-all unit
Ground into sludge and flushed away
Aw geez:.

Soup is good food
You made a good meal, etc:.
We know how much you'd like to die
We joke about it on our coffee breaks
But we're paid to force you to have a nice day
In the wonderful world we made just for you
""Poor Rats"", we human rodents chuckle
At least we get a dignified cremation
At yet
At 6:00 tomorrow morning
It's time to get up and go to work",Food

We'll make it happen, we'll turn it around
Yes, we were born to make history

ebILIKHi9wo,Delta Heavy - White Flag (Official Video),"After the widespread success of their recent ‚ÄòParadise Lost‚Äò album, Delta Heavy‚Äôs untouchable work ethic has assured this momentum is continuing. Capitalising on millions of streams worldwide across multiple platforms, their next release sees them delving into a cross-pollination of genres which yet again solidifies their position as producers who can tap into a vast, versatile soundscape.

Lead single ‚ÄòWhite Flag‚Äô nods to not only their flawless ingenuity, but also their ability to switch up different bpms. This is something they‚Äôre renowned for in the US; the technical ability to travel through genres translates just as well into their production as it has done in their DJ sets. Orchestrated meticulously, ‚ÄòWhite Flag‚Äô juxtaposes a euphoric, incessantly infectious vocal topline with Delta Heavy‚Äôs signature thumping halftime beats, a searing bassline and surging chords. Sounding totally original, the single blends DnB with glittering Electronica resulting in the perfect follow up to ‚ÄòGhost‚Äô, equally at home on daytime radio as well as late night DJ sets.

Everyday is like a blank canvas
You know you can paint it anyway you want it
You can draw black clouds, you can make the sun shine
Color in a rainbow, or use black and white

Open up your eyes and your imagination

Come on let's write a song, a little poetry
Take a photograph, let's make some memories
You can make it anything that you want it to be
If you follow your heart, life is a work of art

Every night's like looking at a dark screen
You're never too young or too old to dream
You can make your fantasy into a reality
Cause you're creating your own masterpiece

Close your eyes and dream it, seeing is believing

Come on let's write a song, a little poetry
Take a photograph, let's make some memories
You can make it anything that you want it to be
If you follow your heart, life is a work of art

Let's write a song, a little poetry
Take a photograph, let's make some memories
You can make it anything that you want it to be
If you follow your heart, life is a work of art

Trying to simplify into philosophy
Turn the star into a galaxy
Make a little noise into a symphony
You're creating a masterpiece

Come on let's write a song, a little poetry
Take a photograph, let's make some memories
You can make it anything that you want it to be
If you follow your heart, life is a work of art

Come on let's write a song, a little poetry
Take a photograph, let's make some memories
You can make it anything that you want it to be

Ready to quit your job and start travelling....? - This video will show you the first steps to find Travel Jobs and other ways to get paid to travel. Additional videos in this series cover more specific forms of Location Independent business models like:

Digital Nomad Jobs allow you to get paid while you travel and are a great way to start a location independent lifestyle. Travel jobs are listed in a number of different places like CoolJobs.com, ResortJobs.com etc.

""Getting Paid to Travel"" happens usually in 2 different ways. You either find Digital Nomad jobs or you start an online business that will keep you afloat for years to come while you can move around freely and live in different countries anytime you wish.

This video covers Travel jobs and a first introduction into location independent Business models.

How about working on a cruise ship or yacht? - it is a great way to see the world with a good salary and minimal expenses since room and board are paid. There are a multitude of different Digital Nomad job types available that allow you to get paid to travel from general hospitality and management all the way to tour guide and entertainer. 

Since applying for cruise ship jobs is a very competitive process, learning the most efficient way to apply - the how and where - will save you years of frustration. 

HOW TO WORK ON A CRUISE SHIP
An excellent course - ""How to Work on a Cruise Ship"" - can be found here: http://sassyzengirl.com/Work-on-Cruise-Ship
created by someone who has successfully done it for years and is considered the top priority in this field. 

Another popular form of Location Independent jobs are National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries. Unless you have special skills or a degree in animal care, agriculture, forestry, marine biology etc., the best way to get in is to volunteer. 

Simply google the country you want to visit and ""National Parks Volunteer programs"" or ""Wildlife Sanctuary Volunteer Program"" and start submitting applications. If it works out well, chances are good that you might be offered a more permanent (paid) position or that the park/sanctuary managers might recommend you to another job opportunity in the field.

Another large area of jobs for Digital Nomads is teaching - both abroad and online. Online teaching gives you greater freedom and flexibility while teaching abroad usually offers better pay and immersion into the local culture.

English is the most popular form of international teaching or online teaching, but any language can work and so can a lot of other skills. Simply visit pages like Instaedu or skillshare, udemy to see what's out there already and in particular, what is selling well, e.g. what people actually want to learn (=much easier to make money at....;-)

Finally, working in resorts, hotels, hostels for a while can be a fun and lucrative way to get paid to travel and land Digital Nomad Jobs while meeting people from all around the world. 

The website resortjobs.com gives a wide range of listings and you can also google the country of your choice + resort jobs etc.

EoYFFbVKX5E,Disneyland FOOD REVIEW! Best &amp; Worst Foods,"I visited the happiest place on earth Disneyland! Disneyland is known for its attractions and rides, but I didn't go there for that. I went to go on a food adventure to see what best and worst foods they served in Disneyland. After touring the food stalls at the park, I had to get some real dinner because eating the food at the park didn't fill me up as much. So I went to eat some Chinese food at one of my favorite restaurants in San Gabriel.

BobGLm4k08Q,Disneyland vs Universal Studios Hollywood: 10 Differences,"Which theme park is better, Disneyland versus Universal Studios Hollywood.  Wondering which park to visit on your trip to Los Angeles?  I compare Disneyland and Universal Studios in 10 different areas.  EXPAND DESCRIPTION FOR MORE.

1 - Park Themes:
Disney: characters and setting from the Disney movie franchise with a large emphasis on their animated films, Mickey, and Minnie Mouse.  But Star Wars is coming soon!  Many rides for fans 2-10 years of age.  And hard-core disney fans, and loyalists.


Universal: Inspired by popular films plus, the movie industry in Hollywood and film production itself with tours of the working studio included with the park‚Äôs general admission.  Gear to a more mature audience than Disneyland

2 - Park Location:
Disney: Anaheim, California -- Orange County.  34 miles south-east of LAX Airport.  About the only thing worth visiting in Anaheim is Disneyland‚Ä¶. And a bunch of things that cater to people who go to Disneyland.  LOTS OF HOTELS!

Universal: Hollywood, 10 miles north-east of downtown LA, on a hill overlooking LA.  26 miles from LAX Airport.  36 miles from Disneyland.

3 - Park Layout:
Disney: 2 Theme Parks, Downtown Disney, Disney Hotels on Property, Monorail, Parking Far Away (parking tram or bus), multiple days to see it all

Universal: Split-level themepark that is pretty small, Universal City Walk, Hilton + Sheraton, Parking Close By, LA Subway, studio tour tram, can do it all in one day

4 - Crowds:
Disney: Usually it‚Äôs packed, all the time.  Parking can take forever.  Security and park entry lines can be long.  Ride lines can be long, 60-90 minutes.

Universal: Way less people most of the summer (summer can be rough).  An hour before park closing time of 9pm lines for many rides were 10 minutes.  Easy to get in to parking, short lines for park entry.

5 - Skip the line:
Disney: Fast pass, Max Pass
Universal: Pay for Express Pass, skip each line once (good if you have limited time)

6 - Kids:
 Disney: 
  = Younger Kids, more strollers
  = Height limit on many rides is 44 inches
  = Child Switch via Fast Pass Return
 Universal: 
  = Older Kids, not too many strollers
  = Height limit 40 inches
  = Child Switch Rooms

7 - Characters:
 Disney: 
  = Long Lines for character meet and greet, but long time with the characters
  = Characters act ‚Äúclassy‚Äù
 Universal:
  = Shorter lines for character pictures, but maybe not known to kids
  = Characters will interact and joke with you walking by
  = Minions, Transformers, Simpsons, Beetlejuice, Kung Fu Panda, Dora the Explorer, SpongeBob 

8 - Costumes:
 Disney: Ears, Hats, Matching Shirts
 Universal: Harry Potter Robes

9 - Attractions/Rides:
Disney: 
  = Amazing theming on the rides, want to ride again and again
  = Best Land: Cars Land
Universal: 
  = Lots of motion projection rides (barf!).  Once and never again. 
  = Many rides feel like they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúdone‚Äù
  = Best Land: Wizarding World of Harry Potter, 
  = Best Ride: Studio Tour

10 - Shows:
Disney: Parades, Frozen, Fireworks, Fantasmic, World of Color
Universal: Waterworld, Animal Actors, Special Effects Show

Conclusion:

Price:  About the same for 1 day tix.  Annual Passes at Universal are cheaper.
Age: Disneyland better for ages 2-10
Location: Universal better for LA attractions
Time: Universal done in a day (15 attractions).  Disney 2-3 days (100 attractions)
Theme: Disneyland is for Disney lovers and it‚Äôs very immersive and well done.  Universal is for ‚Äúmovie‚Äù and Harry Potter fans.

I like Disneyland best. Amazing Experience and atmosphere...You can wander around Disneyland and have a good time without going on a single ride. There's music and entertainment, exhibits, etc.  Go early in the day, and use fast pass.

NEXT LIVE STREAM: Monday March 19, 2018 @ 8pm LA time!  Topic: TBD!  Follow me on Facebook for more updates!

Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF! We visited Dubai in the UAE to try some traditional Emirati Cuisine, and joined up with our friend Peyman to eat a whole camel platter with rice and eggs!

‚ñ∫Check out Peyman's Channel Here: http://bit.ly/PeymanSubscribe

This is a traditional Emirati meal that is usually reserved for special occasions or very exclusive guests. It's not a normal Dubai Street Food, but that's why it's so good. It is an extremely rare Arab food nowadays! You have to be incredibly lucky to experience this whole camel platter! This is definitely one of the must try foods in Dubai! It is a traditional Emirati food and is one of the best things to do in Dubai. Camel meat is something that may be sensitive to some viewers, so make sure you're comfortable with watching the camel cooking! The chefs who prepared the camel recipe were originally from the South of India in Kerala, but have been living in Dubai for over 20 years.

If you're thinking of traveling to Dubai for a food trip, you can't go wrong, there is so much delicious Emirati cuisine and amazing street food to try! I must admit, most of the food is in Dubai restaurants that are clean and quiet, but that is part of the charm of Dubai.

First, Peyman and I checked out the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, and then made our way to the one and only Camel Restaurant, address below:

Entire Camel Platter in Dubai: Zaman Awal Restaurant
Address: Al Boom Village, Dubai, UAE, United Arab Emirates

If you're wondering if you should eat street food in Dubai or go for regular restaurants in Dubai, I recommend mixing it up and going for both. In this food video, we are solely visiting one of the best restaurants in dubai for the whole camel plate.

iBznPAx6ZJY,Dutch Foods To Try,"Dutch Foods To Try - There are a lot of delicious foods to try in The Netherlands so we put together our own little DIY Dutch food tour to try as many as possible. 

One special Dutch food to try in The Netherlands is poffertjes - also known as the world‚Äôs cutest little pancakes. They are teeny tiny, fluffy, and melt in your mouth. They taste heavenly and you shouldn't miss trying them because they are seriously delicious and unique. I loved seeing how they‚Äôre made fresh to order in a poffertjespan. I found watching how they are flipped over super quickly was a bit hypnotic. You can get them with all sorts of toppings. My personal choice was chocolate sauce and powdered sugar. You generally order these by the dozen and you could eat as many and hardly notice because they‚Äôre so light and airy, unlike American pancakes. These Dutch cuties were one of my favourite things we tried in The Netherlands. 

A lot of Dutch snack foods are deep fried. One of the most popular is called a frikandel. It‚Äôs basically a minced-meat, skinless sausage that‚Äôs deep fried. Very similar to a hot dog. Personally the best part of this snack for me was the sauce. The ‚Äòfrinkandel speciaal‚Äô is eaten with mayonnaise, curry ketchup, and chopped onion. It has a nice sweet taste. 

Another popular Dutch snack food is called a kaassouffle (cheese souffle). It‚Äôs melted cheese, usually Gouda, inside a doughy wrap that‚Äôs then deep fried. Cheese is important in The Netherlands and eaten widely. I have yet to see a Dutch refrigerator without a huge block of Gouda in it. Along with the poffertjes, the kaassouffle was my favourite Dutch snack food we tried. It‚Äôs pretty much deep fried cheese so what‚Äôs not to love?

Krokets are a Dutch food you‚Äôll see everywhere and they look similar at first glance to a kaassouffle. A kroket is usually cylindrical and filled with meat. As you might have guessed, it‚Äôs also deep fried. It‚Äôs long been an economical way to use leftovers of meat stew and roasts which are then mixed with gravy, rolled into logs, breaded, and fried. It became really popular during World War II as a cheap food. It‚Äôs crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

Stroopwaffel is quintessentially Dutch. It means syrup waffle and is made by baking a thin waffle and, while it‚Äôs still warm, breaking it in two. Then a warm caramel-like filling is added before the two halves are pushed back together, using the syrup as glue. They‚Äôre very popular to eat on their own or with other sweets. 

We also tried Surinamese and Javanese food, which is widely available in The Netherlands. Suriname and Indonesia were colonized by the Dutch and I was excited to try this type of food as I had never seen it before. My sample dish came with chicken, potato, hard boiled egg, noodles with peanut sauce, rice, vegetables and bread. For dessert, we had a deep fried banana with peanut sauce. I also tried a Surinamese soda called Cherry Bouquet but it was way too sweet for me - even though I have a massive sweet tooth. 

I included fries in this video even though they‚Äôre Belgian, not Dutch. But they‚Äôre really popular in The Netherlands and I didn‚Äôt think I could make a video about foods to try there without including fries. Make sure you try them with lots of different sauces. My favourite is truffle mayonnaise followed closely by curry mayonnaise. 

I hope that you enjoyed seeing these different Dutch foods to try in The Netherlands. I‚Äôd love to know which food you‚Äôd most like to try if you had the opportunity. Or, if you‚Äôve already tried them, which is your favourite?

pf-tQYcZGM4,üì∫ Noam Chomsky&#39;s Manufacturing Consent revisited | The Listening Post,"There is an exquisite and oft-quoted moment in an interview between BBC journalist Andrew Marr and Noam Chomsky in which Marr asks: ""How can you know that I'm self-censoring?"".

""I'm not saying you're self censoring. I'm sure you believe everything you're saying. But what I'm saying is that if you believed something different, you wouldn't be sitting where you're sitting.""

Wry as ever, Chomsky exposed the slightly delusional pretensions of the journalistic establishment - and not far behind, the complicities of the media industry with political power.

Harsh? Perhaps. True? All too often.

For many of us who work at The Listening Post, Chomsky's ideas on the media in Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media have provided us with a guide, full of cautionary tales and ideas that are still controversial to this day.

The book was published in 1988 - a year before the end of the Cold War when it was announced that western liberal democracy had triumphed, heralding the end of ideology, authoritarianism, and propaganda.

In the past 30 years, we have seen the mass communications industry multiply, providing an illusion of choice, echoing the rhetorics of freedom - of press, of expression - but not necessarily yielding the pluralism liberal democracies had promised.

In that way, the book continues to resonate.

But like all revered texts, Manufacturing Consent also calls upon us as active readers, journalists, citizens to interrogate its premises. Does the book's denunciatory tone risk overstate the power of the media establishment? Does it underestimate the critical faculties of the public? Is the media so homogenous an entity that power can be wielded top-down? Where are the lapses, the blind spots? Where do journalists find pockets of power that serve to disrupt?

We spoke to three journalists who have their careers being disruptive and asked them about the ideas that had influenced them in Chomsky and Herman's book: Matt Taibbi, whose reporting for Rolling Stone has provided one of the most critical accounts of US political history in recent years; Indian editor-in-chief Aman Sethi who questions the premises of Chomsky's book and Amira Hass, the Haaretz correspondent for the Occupied Territories.

The first thing we asked Hass was what she thought about Chomsky's statement: ""the general population doesn't know what's happening, and it doesn't even know that it doesn't know"".

""This is a very humanist and optimistic statement,"" she responded. ""The belief that when people are informed they may act, things may change. In Hebrew, the words knowledge and awareness are all made of the same root. Yedda and Mudaoot. And so awareness is connected to Mudaoot in Hebrew. And this is how I started working in Gaza, aware that the Israeli public knows nothing about the occupation and what it means. But the people do not pick up this information. They have access to it but they choose not to access it.""

Hass has been covering Palestine for the best part of 30 years - in that time, sources of information have multiplied, but public outrage?

""Today we have so much access to information in other ways that we are on a collision with the fact that people are not interested in what does not serve immediately their interest,"" she said, with resignation, ""and this is a very sad realisation.""

Aman Sethi put it like this:

""It's easy to say that people believe what they believe because their consent has been manufactured. But what if people know exactly what's going on and still believe what they believe, right? Then that's terrifying.""

Minorities have been even more profoundly affected. African-Americans have a 50 per cent higher prevalence of obesity and Hispanics 25 per cent higher when compared with whites. 

How did the situation get so out of hand? 

On this week's episode of Fault Lines, Josh Rushing explores the world of cheap food for Americans living at the margins. 

What opportunities do people have to eat healthy? Who is responsible for food deserts and processed food in American schools? 

Fault Lines finds food revolutions taking place and speaks with the people that are fighting back.

AFFILIATE LINK DISCLOSURE: Friends, making a quality Loloho video is kind of like making sausage ‚Äì only slightly more violent. It's a ridiculous amount of work that typically involves high dollar camera drops, blue-screen-of-death computer crashes, and at least one angry shotgun wielding old man shouting, ‚ÄúHey! Get the hell outta here!‚Äù Once the final video is posted, rewards here on YouTube are few and far between (unless you are a masochist who enjoys being verbally abused by anonymous trolls). One saving grace is our affiliate links. JUST CLICKING THESE LINKS HELPS TO SUPPORT OUR LITTLE SHOW. Think of this clicking as like tipping - except that it doesn't cost you anything extra! If you eventually make a purchase via one of our affiliate links, we will receive a few pennies (and Sean typically invests these pennies in duct tape and video gear). Again, it doesn't cost you anything to click these links, and it's a great help to us. As always, safe travels, happy camping, and THANK YOU!",Travel

Disclaimer: This series is intended for students, to give them a broad overview of a complicated subject that has driven world history for centuries. Our story begins and focuses on the Romane Empire.

A centuary after Constantine, the Emperor Theodosius II found himself wrapped up in yet more theological disputes. His chosen patriarch of Constantinople, Archbishop Nestorius, had angered many other church leaders with his teachings that Christ had separate human and divine natures. Cyril of Alexandria wrote to the Pope in Rome for support against Nestorius, and received permission to excommunicate him. Nestorius responded by having the emperor call an ecumenical council, at which he intended to excommunicate Cyril. But Cyril acted first, declaring for the excommunication of Nestorius and forming a majority by pushing the council to begin early before the supporters of Nestorius could gather. When they did, they formed their own council and excommunicated Cyril right back, only to be excommunicated in turn by Cyril's Council of Ephesus. Theodosius II attempted to resolve this by calling a second council, but this time none of the Western delegates had time to arrive and in their absence, monophysite leaders from the East excommunicated Nestorius again and declared monophysitism the official doctrine of the church. Those who didn't get to participate called this the Robbers Council and refused to acknowledge it. Then Theodosius II died, and this fight devolved onto his successor, Marcian. Marcian called together the Council of Chalcedon to rule on the previous councils, where it was finally decided that Christ had two unified natures, human and divine, and everyone who'd supported the Robbers Council should be excommunicated. Instead of bringing Christians together under an orthodox theology, they split the faith as those who wouldn't accept their decisions continued to preach and believe their own doctrines and a multitude of Christian sects became their own separate orders. Ultimately, these new denominations followed regional lines, which meant that different areas of the empire formed distinct cultural identities shaped in part by their faith, and these areas were less connected to Constantinople and became the first to split off as the empire weakened over the centuries.

6m8PmMQK76s,Early Motorcycle Manufacture - The Rover Imperial (*silent movie),"Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/2kKTBIM

www.iomtt.com

Grab yourself a brew, sit back and watch this enchanting video of a Rover motorcycle being constructed back in the good old days of hand crafted machinery.  From casting the cylinders to machining the crank and assembling the engine, this a wonderful insight into the vintage days of building motorcycles for the road.  And keep your eye out for the test rider who hits the water feature with a little bit too much gusto!

The Rover company began to develop and produced the Rover Imperial motorcycle in November 1902. This was a 3.5hp diamond-framed motorcycle with the engine in the centre and 'springer' front forks, an improvement ahead of its time. The first Rover motorcycle had innovative features such as a spray carburettor, a bottom-bracket engine, and mechanically operated valves. Featuring a strong frame with double front down tubes and a good quality finish, over a thousand Rover motorcycles were sold in 1904.

Today, we're going DEEP for Traditional Egyptian Cuisine in the back streets of Alexandria. We're having some AMAZING Egyptian Seafood and a HUGE Egyptian BREAKFAST!

‚ñ∫My Egyptian Food Guide To Alexandria : https://www.thefoodranger.com/what-to-eat-in-alexandria-egypt/

In this street food vlog, we are traveling in Egypt up to Alexandria, famous for it's long history and delicious seafood. We're bringing you to try some AMAZING Egyptian Street food cooked by local chefs using famous Egyptian recipes. The flavours you can try here are so delicious!

Starting out, we're going for a traditional egyptian breakfast, served with Foul Fava bean dip, baba ganoush, Egyptian bread, and many more egyptian dishes. If you're wondering what do Egyptians eat, this is it, a healthy breakfast with lots of delicious baladi bread.These are all super delicious Ancient Egyptian recipes and super popular with the locals, using only the best Egyptian spices!!

After that amazing Egyptian breakfast, we're going for more Egyptian street food, but first, a stop at an amazing Alexandria cheese fondue restaurant, full of delicious beef and seafood!

And next up, we're going for the best seafood in Egypt, DEEP in the local seafood market of Alexandria, where you can buy incredibly fresh Seafood and bring it to the local grills nearby to cook in the Egyptian style. Here, we had a delicious baked fish, some squid, crab, and more. It was amazing! 

And to finish up our day of Egyptian street food after that amazing Seafood, we're going for one more Egyptian street food, the fried liver sandwiches! This is another specialty of Alexandria, and we found the best one in the city! Although I personally found it too strong, many locals love the flavour and all the Egyptian dishes that come with it!

When Robert Harley steps in as England's new Chancellor of the Exchequer, he discovers that not only is the government deeply in debt, but no one knows quite how much debt it owes. Because vicious political infighting between the Tory and Whig politic parties made it difficult to pass new tax laws, Harley turned to a private financier named John Blunt to help find enough money for England to keep up with its expenses for the year. Using Harley's government resources, Blunt instigated a series of get-rich schemes that drove artificial demand for unsustainable land and lottery investments with tremendous short term gains. Before the year was done, Blunt had successfully covered the shortfall for the government that year - albeit at the cost of driving England's already outrageous debt even higher.

Thanks to his mother's support, John Snow rose from humble beginnings as a coal miner's son and apprenticed to a doctor in Newcastle. As a young man, he treated many patients during the cholera epidemic that struck Newcastle. He noticed that the traditional explanation for cholera's spread - miasma from graveyards and swamps - could not explain its appearance in Newcastle where he treated patients. He took that knowledge with him to London, where he formally studied medicine and achieved the highest honors in his profession in only a year. His formal study of anesthesia earned him such great recognition that on two occasions he was trusted to work on the Queen. But then cholera broke out in London again. Snow wanted to prove miasma didn't cause it and find the real cause, so he interviewed patients and doctors across the city. He theorized that the diarrhea which came from cholera also helped to spread it. He even wrote up a case study where one street whose well water mixed with sewage had a huge infection rate while across the street their neighbors with pure well water barely suffered at all. Confident that he had found the cause, he published his findings, but the medical community was not thoroughly convinced.

'World War One - 1914' is the first in a five-part series covering the Great War. This episode covers the rival alliances that dominated Europe in the build-up to war, the Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente, and the fatal gunshots by Gavrilo Princip at Sarajevo that resulted in the death of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. 

Imperial rivalries, the system of alliances and deep-seated animosities helped propel Europe into a general war. However Woodrow Wilson, the US President, ensured America stood apart from Europe's conflict. In August 1914, Germany invaded France and Belgium as part of the Schlieffen Plan. The tiny British Expeditionary Force could only hold up the German army for a few hours at the Battle of Mons, but later joined the French in saving Paris at the Battle of the Marne. The 'Race to the Sea' followed, leading to the First Battle of Ypres, as both sides tried to outflank each other to the north. Their failure led to a stalemate, in which the devastating power of machineguns and artillery forced infantry of both sides to take cover in deep trenches. 

At sea, Britain's Royal Navy won the war's first naval battle at Heligoland Bight, and imposed a naval blockade on Germany, preventing war supplies (including, controversially, food) from reaching the country by sea. HMS Pathfinder was soon sunk by a German U-boat, revealing the potential of Germany's submarines to overturn Britain's long-held naval dominance.

On the Eastern Front, a Russian invasion of East Prussia ended in disaster at the Battle of Tannenberg, masterminded by German generals Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff. A second victory at the Battle of Masurian Lakes sent the Russian army into retreat. Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia began badly, with defeat at the Battle of Cer. Things went even worse on the Russian front, as Austria's offensive against the Russians leads to heavy losses, and forced Germany to come to the rescue, by launching the Battle of ≈Å√≥d≈∫.

In Africa, British, French and German colonial forces clashed in British East Africa (Kenya), Togoland (Togo), German South-West Africa (Namibia), and German Kamerun (Cameroon). German Colonel Paul von Lettow-Vorbek had notable success repelling the British at the Battle of Tanga. 

In the Pacific, Japan honoured its alliance with Britain and seized the German naval base at Tsingtao in China. Task forces from Australia and New Zealand secured the German colonies of Samoa and New Guinea. German Admiral von Spee's East Asia Squadron won victory at the Battle of Coronel, off Chile, before sailing into catastrophe at the Battle of the Falkland Islands. In the Middle East, British troops occupied Basra, securing access to Persian oil for their fleet.

Winter 1914 saw the French launch their first major offensive to break the trench stalemate of the Western Front. But the First Battle of Champagne led to heavy losses for no real gains. Ottoman operations in the Caucasus Mountains also ended in disaster at the Battle of Sarikamish. The war's first Christmas was marked by games of football in No Man's Land on the Western Front, but early hopes of a short war had now been entirely quashed.

CORRECTION: 7.55 - the map shows Cyprus as part of the Ottoman Empire. Cyprus was part of the Ottoman Empire from 1570 to 1914, but when the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers in November 1914, Cyprus was annexed by Britain.

xJkevg0UGhQ,Ethics of Active Defence,"Patrick Neal, DSSc, Active Cyber Deterrence Researcher
Robert Slade, CISSP, Researcher, author, bombast

This presentation takes the position of active defence as a moral and ethical obligation of the Information Society which must be embedded in public policy and framed into legislative and regulatory instruments. Starting with a short history of strikeback lobbying, the presentation then presents a moral and ethical framework for promoting active defence as a societal obligation.  Taking this position, it is proposed active defence be linked to the society's collective safety and security.  The presentation is based on four years of exploratory doctoral research examining corporate decision makers' attitudes towards active cyber defence.  The research include industry/government consultation, survey methodology, and utilization of established social contract theory, cyber deterrence, deterrence, and information theory.

Biographies:
Patrick Neal has been involved in the justice and public safety field since 1982. He has been a soldier, prison librarian, security supervisor, investigator, and policy researcher. In 2010 he became the Crime and Intelligence Analysis Program Coordinator in the Forensic Science and Technology department at the British Columbia Institute of Technology. Throughout his career, he has used data and information to; develop better responses to justice and public safety incidents, inform policy development, develop insights into how people search for and use data and information. He completed his Master of Arts (Royal Roads University) degree during which he studied the information seeking behavior of police officers. He is awaiting the award of his Doctor of Social Sciences (Royal Roads University) thesis: Protecting the Information Society: An Exploratory Study of Corporate Decision makers‚Äô attitudes towards Active Cyber Defence.  His special area of interest is cyber deterrence, information weaponization, social contract theory, and intelligence /analysis within the cyber domain.  His other life includes a passion for museums, old books, antiques, and fishing.

Rob Slade has a copy of John Rawls' ""Social Justice,"" which he probably hasn't cracked since university. More information than anyone would want to know about him is available at:

Although it finds Peter the Hermit's group from the People's Crusade in shambles, the summer of 1096 finally sees the ""official"" forces of the First Crusade set out for Jerusalem. This was not one army, however, but five separate armies led by men with very different motivations and sympathies - many of them surprisingly hostile towards the Pope or the Byzantine Empire. Hugh of Vermandois, brother of the King of France, led one army despite his brother having been excommunicated by Pope Urban II.  Godfrey de Bouillon from the German territory had actually helped kick the Pope out of Rome and install the anti-Pope. Bohemond of Taranto brought an army whose experience primarily came from fighting the Romans twelve years prior. Raymond of Toulouse led the largest army and believed himself the main leader of the Crusade, despite the fact that he traveled with the Pope's appointed leader, Bishop Adhemar. Only Robert of Flanders could be said to be on good terms with both the Pope and the Eastern Roman Empire. When the five armies arrived in Constantinople, Emperor Alexius Comnenus approached them all privately with bribes and threats to get them to swear an oath that any land they conquered on Crusade would be returned to him. They all took it (except Bohemond's nephew, Tancred) and so the emperor sent them across the Bosphorus to attack the Turks at last.

TjqRJZswl-U,Exclusive tour of LG&#39;s OLED R&amp;D and manufacturing facilites in South Korea,"Check out our CES 2019 coverage! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZEIwIHCxaFWx-I3KSJo8XKh2JkzWhvZF

LG brought Digital Trends along on an exclusive tour of several of its labs and factories halfway around the globe in Seoul, South Korea -- and we‚Äôre bringing you inside with us.

Make no mistake: Much of what we saw was confidential information, of the ‚ÄúI could tell you but I‚Äôd have to kill you‚Äù sort. But we can share enough to give you a rare peek behind the curtain.

The Paju complex is made up of eight enormous buildings each seemingly larger than an airport terminal that sit on 420 acres. A ninth, called P9, is currently under construction. When completed, it will be the world‚Äôs largest OLED manufacturing plant. More than 17,000 people work at Paju, many living in enormous residential complexes on site. 

We flew on the LG helicopter an hour south to the Gumi facility, where LG assembles OLED and LED televisions. It was especially big: Picture several warehouses fused together. It doesn‚Äôt require the clean-room garb we donned for phone assembly. Because technology changes so rapidly, assembly lines are designed to be modular. 

The Seocho Research & Development facility. It was born in 2009, and over 3000 people work there, giving birth to high-tech ideas from a glimmering pool of silicon and ambition. And as such, it‚Äôs one of the super secretive facilities that LG guards closely: Admission to Seocho meant forfeiting cell phones and laptops, signing non-disclosure forms, and so on. Indeed, we were only allowed to record a short video outside of the building.

_aVAzeajusg,"Exhibition Insight | Vermeer and Music: The Art of Love and Leisure | The National Gallery, London","Put sound to picture as curator Betsy Wieseman explores the fascinating role of music in 17th century Dutch painting and society in this accompaniment to 'Vermeer and Music: The Art of Love and Leisure'.  

'Vermeer and Music: The Art of Love and Leisure' offers an opportunity to enjoy a selection of 17th century Dutch masterpieces alongside period musical instruments, with accompaniment from the Academy of Ancient Music. Featuring five rare works from Johannes Vermeer, including three paintings of women with musical instruments from 1670 - 1672, which forms the culmination of the exhibition and offers a unique opportunity to view these works as a trio. 

Join exhibition curator Betsy Wieseman as she explains how Vermeer's musical subjects explore variations on a similar theme - in much the same way that a musician might. And listen to music of the era played by musicians from the Academy of Ancient Music.

Find out why music was such an important part of society in the Dutch Golden Age -- and why the guitar was believed to be an instrument of the devil.

5spI5HVgBhM,Explore MIT Today: Reverse Engineering the Mind: Brain and Cognitive Sciences,"James DiCarlo, Head of the MIT Brain and Cognitive Sciences Department, leads a panel discussion and audience Q&A related to how the study of the mind and brain, merged with the creation of engineered systems, enables a deeper understanding of human intelligence. This wide-ranging discussion touches on topics such as analogies between neural processing in the brain and deep learning networks, innate knowledge and how infants learn, the challenges of building general purpose robots, human-brain interfaces, technological advances in the treatment of brain disorders and sensory deficits, and ethical issues that arise in brain science and AI. Panelists are MIT faculty Antonio Torralba, Josh Tenenbaum, Josh McDermott, and Leslie Kaelbling. This event was hosted by the MIT Brain and Cognitive Sciences Department and the MIT Alumni Association.

Kunming, Yunnan, China - Kunming is the capital and largest city in Yunnan province China. So I was excited to explore the local market in Kunming and eat as much street food as possible!

Here are all the Chinese street food dishes we ate throughout the market:

Rice pudding - 5 RMB ($0.76) - This was slightly fermented, and sweet, like a rice alcohol pudding. It was pretty good, but quite sweet, so I couldn‚Äôt eat that much of it.

Dumpling - 1 RMB ($0.15) - I saw these dumplings sizzling and hissing and there was no way I could walk by without trying one. Stuffed inside were leek and egg. They were a little on the oily side, but delicious.

Whole duck - 20 RMB ($3.03) - Yunnan is famous for roast duck, and there‚Äôs a version that‚Äôs comparable even to Beijing style. Style I was excited to find a stall that at the market that specialize in Yunnanese roast duck. It was delicious and the owners were very friendly as well.

Pickled pears - 5 RMB ($0.76) - This was an interesting snack, and supposed to be very healthy and good for digestion. 

Drink - 2 RMB ($0.30) - This drink was incredible sweet, but refreshing.

Tofu Noodles - 5.5 RMB ($0.83) - Another extremely popular Chinese street food snack at the market was tofu noodles - I‚Äôve had tofu and noodles, but not really mixed before. It was a little plain and starchy, but from all the sauces, it was taty.
Rice balls - 5 RMB ($0.76) - We also tried sesame rice balls which were delicious.

Jacuzzi braised ¬Ω chicken - 15 RMB ($2.27) - This was one of the highlights of the market for me, mainly because the owner was so friendly and his giant jacuzzi of boiling chickens was amazing to see! The chicken was a little bony, but flavorful.

Yellow soybean porridge - 3.5 RMB ($0.53) - As we were leaving the market, we stopped for one last bowl of soybean porridge to eat with youtiau, Chinese donuts. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to like it as much as I did, but it was delicious. It was very warming and hearty.

Finally to complete this Chinese street food tour in Kunming, Jerry and I, along with his family ate Chinese Yunnanese bbq. It was tasty and a great way to end this amazing day of street food.

Special thanks to Zouba Tours (http://www.zoubatours.com/) for arranging everything in this video. I paid for this tour, but I think they did a great job, and I thoroughly enjoyed the food and the tour.

That completes Day 4 of this Chinese food tour of Yunnan. If you haven‚Äôt already, watch the full series here: https://goo.gl/QhiJUb

x2LYZul94wQ,Extreme Science: The U.S. Antarctic Program,"Antarctica is the coldest, highest and driest of all seven continents.  It is one and a half times the areal size of the continental United States, with the vast majority of its landmass covered in thick ice sheets. 

In the surrounding Southern Ocean, sea ice covering an area about equal to the continent in size freezes and melts annually.  The Antarctic continent and surrounding ocean are distinct in being governed through an international treaty system comprised of the Antarctic Treaty and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctica Marine Living Resources. The Antarctic Treaty System emphasizes peaceful uses of the region with a particular focus on scientific research.  The National Science Foundation manages the U.S. Antarctic science program on behalf of all of government. The U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) continually evolves with the frontiers of science and takes advantage of opportunities for discovery afforded by the unique life and environments of Antarctica.  This talk will describe current USAP goals and highlights as well as the challenges of providing logistics support to make research possible in this remote and intrinsically inhospitable region.

Speaker: Kelly Kenison Falkner, Ph.D., is the Director of the Office of Polar Programs of the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF).  She also serves as Director of the U.S. Antarctic Program, which NSF manages on behalf of all of U.S. government in accordance with Presidential Memorandum 6626 and the terms of the Antarctic Treaty System.  A member of the Senior Executive Service, Dr. Falkner oversees an annual budget of about $450 million covering scientific research and logistics programs in both the Arctic and Antarctic.

Dr. Falkner joined NSF in 2010 as Deputy Director of the Office of Polar Programs and transitioned to Director in 2012.  During the International Polar Year (2007-08), Dr. Falkner undertook a two-year Intergovernmental Personnel Act assignment at NSF as the founding director for the Antarctic Integrated System Science Program for which she was recognized by the naming of Falkner Glacier located in Mountaineer Range, Victoria Land, Antarctica (2009).

Dr. Falkner currently serves as the Head of the U.S. Delegation to the Arctic Council Ad Hoc Task Force for Enhancing Scientific Cooperation and as a member of the U.S. Delegation to the annual Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.  She is a delegate to the WMO Expert Council for Polar and High Mountain Observations, Research and Services.  She is also the lead U.S. representative on the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs.  Dr. Falkner has testified before U.S. Congressional committees on three occasions.

 Prior to Federal service, she was a Professor in the College of Oceanic & Atmospheric Sciences, Oregon State University, where she taught, conducted research for 16 years. She and her team executed state-of-the-art chemical measurements to investigate a wide array of environmental topics the results of which are presented in over 60 peer reviewed journal articles and book chapters.

Dr. Falkner conducted postdoctoral studies at MIT in 1990 under an NSF Women‚Äôs Initiation Award and at the Centre National D‚ÄôEtudes Spatiales in Toulouse, France in 1990-1992 under a NATO Postdoctoral Fellowship and CNRS Poste Rouge respectively.  She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Chemistry with a minor in Russian studies from Reed College with Phi Beta Kappa distinction in 1983 and a PhD in Chemical Oceanography from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution-MIT Joint Program in Oceanography in 1989.

pRK-cI1MpD8,Facial Recognition Offers New Insights into Architectural History,"Look at a map of roads or railroad tracks‚Äîthe winding lines suffuse the terrain like veins in a body.

That‚Äôs no accident, because ‚Äúthey are the stuff of life,‚Äù writes Peter Christensen, an assistant professor of art history.

Trained as an architect as well as a scholar, Christensen is the author of a new book‚ÄîGermany and the Ottoman Railways: Art, Empire, and Infrastructure (Yale, 2017)‚Äîthat considers globalization through the lens of an immense civil works project that spanned cultures and borders in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

While buildings may be the glamourous figures in architecture, ‚Äúinfrastructure is what modernizes us,‚Äù Christensen says. And he argues that it deserves a place in architectural history not just as technology, but also as art.

‚ÄúInfrastructures make empires,‚Äù he declares on the book‚Äôs first page. ‚ÄúThe economic, social, and cultural systems of empires are guided by and given form and purpose through canals, bridges, tunnels, ports, and, perhaps most importantly, railways.‚Äù

And the construction of infrastructure is, at many levels, a collaborative one, crossing boundaries to take advantage of expertise and finances, and reliant not just on the vision of architects and engineers but of local laborers, too. ‚ÄúThere are multiple layers of authorship involved in the creation of buildings and all the other objects that go into engineering a railway network,‚Äù says Christensen, who has also studied a similar effort in western Canada.

Conceived of by the Ottoman sultan, the railways of the Ottoman Empire‚Äîwhich encompassed the lands of what are now Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq, Israel, and Greece‚Äîwere largely a German project in engineering, materials, and finances. But the relationship between the two empires was always an ambiguous one. While the German Empire was a rising power during the Ottoman Empire‚Äôs decline, and the railway project was characterized by the international press as a colonial one, with Germany at the helm, the connection was more dynamic than antagonistic, Christensen argues. 

He finds testament to the cross-cultural nature of the effort in material artifacts of the Ottoman railway, including train stations, maps, bridges, and monuments. German architects created standard designs for the railway stations based on the size of the towns‚Äô populations. But he didn‚Äôt see such replication when he studied the stations that were actually built. Instead, he found that key elements of design‚Äîthe form of the windows, for instance, or the stone carving‚Äîwere the handiwork of workers across the multicultural Ottoman Empire, laboring in different environmental conditions and drawing on their own cultural aesthetics. 

‚ÄúThis is the moment that crystalizes globalization in architecture,‚Äù Christensen says, ‚Äúbecause styles are conflating freely, ideas and models of architecture are traveling and being changed.‚Äù

His book is part of a larger project that also involves three-dimensional imaging. He and his research team have used 3D scanning to map precisely where the various Ottoman railway stations differ, zeroing in on the contributions of on-the-ground laborers, who typically figure little in architectural history. It‚Äôs a technology that he‚Äôs continuing to develop‚Äîwith current collaborations at the Rochester Museum and Science Center and the Museum of Modern Art‚Äîto yield a tool he hopes will be broadly useful to architectural and art historians.  

Christensen‚Äôs book is also the product of a low-tech but time-honored skill for art historians: scouring the archives. Few of the images that fill his book have been published before, but Christensen says the importance of the Ottoman railway continues to reverberate in contemporary life. ‚ÄúAs recently as 100 years ago, the borders of these now geopolitical hotspots were completely different‚Äîand this railway was meant to connect these disparate lands,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAfter World War I, the border between Syria and Turkey was made by the railway line‚Äîit was an arbitrary line in the proverbial sand.

‚ÄúWe live with the after effects of the creation of these networks to this day.‚Äù

LYRICS:
I ºll start with a taco, soft like a cloud 
I want mine crunchy, I like to eat loud. 
I ºll choose a chalupa, I ºll grab a gordita, 
and two taco salads for our senoritas. 
And a Burrito Supreme, with extra sour cream 
It ºs a cylindrically shaped seasoned beef dream. 
A taquito. An enchirito. Some cinnamon twists. 
A chicken border bowl.  Are you gettin º all this? 

And you know that nothing beats a 
hmmm, mmmm...Mexican Pizza... 
We ºll take two of those, but please hold the diced tomatoes. 
And I admit, I ºve always felt, 
like I ºm in love with the meximelt.

No! I ºm not done...I ºll also take a...

And make my sauce Fire. Uh, he ºll take mild.

I ºm stealing your online code if you win it. 
Why would you do that? You owe me 25 bones 
I owe you 5.  Plus interest--it was a loan.

Learn more about the fast food industry: http://bit.ly/XfW7ol

Don Henderson (Greg Kinnear)-a marketing executive at Mickey's Fast Food Restaurant chain, home of ""The Big One""-has a problem. Contaminated meat is getting into the frozen patties of the company's best-selling burger. To find out why, he'll have to take a journey to the dark side of the All-American meal.

Leaving the cushy confines of the company's Southern California boardroom for the immigrant-staffed slaughterhouses, teeming feedlots and cookie cutter strip malls of Middle America, what Don discovers is a Fast Food Nation of consumers who haven't realized it is they who are being consumed by an industry with a seemingly endless appetite for fresh meat.

jAjUqwauf-A,First Opium War - Gunboat Diplomacy - Extra History - #3,"The British set up a blockade outside Canton, but one of their own private merchant ships tried to run through it. When the Chinese came to its defense, war began in earnest. Since the British had far superior firepower, they easily conquered Chuenpee and Chusan. Elliot and the Emperor's new envoy, Qishan, soon sought a treaty and agreed on generous terms... which their overseers harshly rejected.

____________

The British responded to the Chinese halting their ships by erecting a blockade outside Canton. They fired a warning shot to turn back a private British merchant ship, the Royal Saxon, which attempted a blockade run, and the Chinese sent out their own navy to defend the runner. They were demolished. The British had better ships and better firepower. They made to discuss a treaty, but the Chinese refused to give in to the British demands regarding ownership of Hong Kong. The British moved on to capture Chusan, an island near Shanghai. Then a rumor prompted them to believe that China planned to strike against them, so they acted pre-emptively and kicked off the Battle of Chuenpee. Again they won, but the slaughter was so horrifying that Superintendent Elliot was glad to seek a peace treaty with the emperor's envoy, Qishan. Finally Qishan agreed to give up Hong Kong, to give the British better trade status, in exchange for which Britain returned the land they'd taken. But Elliot's supervisor back in London, Lord Palmerston, felt the treaty didn't go far enough, especially since it didn't re-establsih opium trading rights. And the Emperor found Qishan's capitulation disgraceful, even threatened to have him hanged for it. What had looked like moderate wins for both sides suddenly threatened to fall apart.

16 agents create a spontaneous musical in a food court in a Los Angeles mall.  Using wireless microphones and the mall's PA system, both their voices and the music was amplified throughout the food court.  All cameras were hidden behind two-way mirrors and other concealed structures. 

This is one of over 100 different missions Improv Everywhere has executed over the past seven years in New York City.  Others include Frozen Grand Central, the Food Court Musical, and the famous No Pants Subway Ride, to name a few.

- The food in this film was consumed either by myself or my dog after shooting. None of the cast went to waste.
- The software used was photoshop and after effects.
- The film took me 3 months to do.
- Although it seems like stop motion, most of it was stop motion created within After effects, using keyframe animation. I am basically moving the food around within the the program, frame by frame, which is the same as traditional stop motion, only it's digital.",Food

5RwIWGkMxrE,Food Fight: How Corporations Ruined Food (Food Industry Documentary) - Real Stories,"When we walk into a supermarket, we assume that we have the widest possible choice of healthy foods. But in fact, over the course of the 20th century, our food system was co-opted by corporate forces whose interests do not lie in providing the public with fresh, healthy, sustainably-produced food.

Fortunately for America, an alternative emerged from the counter-culture of California in the late 1960s and early 1970s, where a group of political anti-corporate protesters‚Äìled by Alice Waters‚Äìvoiced their dissent by creating a food chain outside of the conventional system. The unintended result was the birth of a vital local-sustainable-organic food movement which has brought back taste and variety to our tables.

FOOD FIGHT is a fascinating look at how American agricultural policy and food culture developed in the 20th century, and how the California food movement has created a counter-revolution against big agribusiness.

COLOMBO, SRI LANKA - Sri Lankan food is known for crabs, and you‚Äôll find some of the best mud crabs you‚Äôll ever try in Sri Lanka. One of the top places to eat Sri Lankan crab curry is The Station, a seafood restaurant and bar along the ocean in Colombo. During out best of Sri Lankan food tour (https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry.tourist/), this was the first meal we had, and it was outstanding.

I met up with Uchith (https://www.instagram.com/uchith/), Nick (https://www.instagram.com/nimz_gd/), and Lakki (https://www.instagram.com/lakkiw/), who showed me the restaurant and took me to the kitchen to watch as they made their entire family recipe for Sri Lankan crab curry, using huge 1.5 kg. Sri Lankan mud crabs. It was fascinating and a learning experiences to watch all the different steps and the complicated ingredients used in their recipe.

As I kept watching the Sri Lankan crab curry being made, I could hardly contain my excitement or mouth juices!

Our entire group came, and they started bringing out more dishes - not just the Sri Lankan crab curry, but river prawns fried in black pepper, and spiny lobster hollowed out and re-added to its shell. It was stunningly good. Along with Sri Lankan food, The Station also has a few of their own unique, Sri Lankan fusion seafood dishes, including favorites like hot butter squid.

Sri Lankan crab curry - we had one pan of their original Sri Lankan family recipe crab curry, and one pan of their extra spicy crab curry. Both were outstanding, but I loved the original for the spice blend and balance and how all the juices soaked up into the crab, it was outstanding. 

The Sri Lankan food and crab curry was outstanding, the people, our entire group, and the owners of The Station are incredible people as well. Thank you to The Station, Nick, Uchitch and Lakki.

RwZY1jaw2EM,Food Matters (PART 1) - First 8 Minutes,"Dear Friend,

What you're about to learn could likely save your life, or that of someone you love. This was certainly the case with my Father. 

About 6 years ago my Father was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Depression and Anxiety. The best the medical profession could offer was a cocktail of medications to treat the symptoms and little in the way of hope for treating the underlying causes. Not surprisingly his health continued to decline.

At the same time we were studying nutrition and sending my father many books we had read but these didn't seem to help convince him. So for the next 12 months (with 3 years of research up our sleeves) we set about creating the independent documentary film 'Food Matters'.

'Food Matters' features interviews with leading health experts who reveal the best natural healing choices you can make for you and your family's health. In the film you'll discover what works, what doesn't and what's killing you.

Needless to say after my father saw the film he quit his pharmaceutical meds, changed his diet, lost 20% of his body weight and is now running 3 times a week which is a big change from being bed ridden for 5 years!

Thank you for your support in helping this lifesaving information reach more people, it would not be possible without you.

James Colquhoun & Laurentine ten Bosch

Producer / Directors 'Food Matters'

PS: You don't have to take our word for it, here is what others are saying about the film.  

""Everything I have been harping on for the last 40 years, these two have brilliantly encapsulated in one beautifully produced, eminently watchable video."" - Harvey Diamond, Author of America's best selling health book 'Fit For Life'

""This film lays out the inconvenient truth the food industry doesn't want you to hear -- that nearly all degenerative disease is actually caused by the processed, nutrient-depleted food being consumed in first-world nations around the world. 'Food Matters' dares to reveal how we can stop this cycle of destruction and restore true health to ourselves and our planet."" - Mike Adams founder of Natural News.com


 ""Anyone who is serious about their health needs to see this stunning film.""
- Christiane Northrup, MD, author of the Women's Wisdom series


 ""James and Laurentine provide a radiant beacon of hope with steps you can do today to take control of your health and begin healing. This is such important information - and much aligned with my personal health philosophies. It's time to get it out to everyone who will listen. I encourage you to order a copy of Food Matters today and watch it with your friends and family.""

""With nutritionally-depleted foods, chemical additives and ourtendency to rely upon pharmaceutical drugs to treat what's wrong with

And in what promises to be the most contentious idea put forward, the filmmakers have interviewed several world leaders in nutrition and natural healing who claim that not only are we harming our bodies with improper nutrition, but that the right kind of foods, supplements and detoxification can be used to treat chronic illnesses as fatal as terminally diagnosed cancer.

The sector is also the key to providing safe foods in an economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable manner to a growing world population on an ever decreasing cultivatable land footprint.

The effects of changing consumer demands, government edicts about dietary diseases; such as obesity and diabetes, and natural disasters mean this fast moving industry requires confident, reliable, enthusiastic employees with an excellent understanding of food production, and the skills to manage complex supply chains on a local and a global scale.

Our courses aim to equip you with the skills, knowledge, and confidence to lead this industry; either from within a large corporation, or through your own entrepreneurial business start-up. You will graduate with a food degree that is focussed towards your own interests and career aspirations; whether that is as a buyer of sustainable food ingredients, a quality or technical manager, a government adviser on food policy, or the CEO of your own food business.

Khayber Pass, a mountain pass in north Pakistan. Close to the border of Afghanistan. It also has been the gateway of South Asia ( part of the ancient silk route). It connects the Afghan territories via torkham. Security is the main concern out there currently.

The clock tower is commonly known as ‚Äúghanta ghar‚Äù located at chowk yaadgar at a distance from the city‚Äôs busy centre. It was inaugurated in 1900 in honour to celebrate the diamond jubilee of British queen Victoria. 

The most important part of Peshawar‚Äôs local food is meat which is cooked in form ‚Äútikka‚Äù, ‚Äú karhai‚Äù ‚Äúdumpukht‚Äù etc. The people there are fond of lamb meat. The way to order it at any eatery is select the variety and amount of meat, and they cook it in your presence.

TeLiBBxIbaw,Foods You are NOT Allowed to Eat In the USA !,"Whether it‚Äôs rotten cheese consumed by maggots, or mysterious brownies that make you really sleepy, here are foods you‚Äôre not allowed to eat in the US

Subscribe to American Eye http://goo.gl/GBphkv

6. Mirabelle Plum
Don‚Äôt get caught acting suspicious around the police if you got a few of these illegal plums stashed on you! These plums you see here are grown only in the Lorraine region of France and people from the US won‚Äôt get to taste them unless they travel to western europe. You‚Äôre probably thinking, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the big deal‚Äù? They‚Äôre just plums for crying out loud not an endangered species or anything. It‚Äôs somewhat of a mystery why exactly they‚Äôre banned but the answer seems to come down to money. In order to protect the financial income of the eastern province in France, most countries have agreed not to sell them. It‚Äôs a little bit similar to how we have to have the differences between Champagne and Sparkling water. Whatever the reason exactly might be, you aren‚Äôt allowed to eat them, cuz we said so! 

5. Unpasteurized Milk
Most of the milk we drink and the cheese we eat must go through a process known as pasteurization first before we consume it. The process was introduced by Louis Pasteur in the 1860‚Äôs and This kills the bacteria and other microbes which would be harmful for consumption . not only that but this allows for it to be stored on the shelf longer. Although some states allow the sale for raw milk 17 states have banned it. Those who are in favor of non pasteurization claim that the milk loses many of its nutrients once it goes through the process.  But those who claim pasteurized milk is the way to go state that too many diseases are spread from just raw milk. In any case, it is probably best not to drink raw milk unless it‚Äôs from the mom to the offspring

4. Lazy Cakes
This cakes are banned in arkansas and strangely enough, they might actually make you feel lazy. The brownies are laced with melatonin and are known to cause severe drowsiness. Melatonin is often used as an over the counter sleep supplement and typically isn‚Äôt found in our food. Rumors went on full effect when people started saying that they put some type of synthetic cannabis substance in there but in any case they will make people sleepy. Maybe people who sell them don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôre not your average brownie, and you have to kind of read the fine print to find out. 


3. Pig‚Äôs Blood Cake
Who on Earth would eat something that sounds this horrifying? If you guessed the Taiwanese, good job! Pig‚Äôs blood cake has been banned in the US due to sanitary reasons and whatever other reason they find is fine by me. No need to guess what the secret ingredient is with this one. It‚Äôs basically like a street food delicacy that‚Äôs made with soy broth, sticky rice and oh yeah, pigs blood! The rice is then dipped in blood and deep fried. Other ingredients might be used to coat the deep fried pig blood on a stick but once you eat it, you have to live with yourself! Supporters of the treat claim there is no sanitary issues with the preparation process but it‚Äôs still banned here!


2. Conch Queen
This beautiful shellfish becomes actually pretty tasty once you open it up and eat it. The conch queen is a banned food in the US to import mostly because overfishing threatens its existence. It‚Äôs actually more like a giant sea snail which has a very sturdy shell. The caribbean is the main exporter of conch meat to the us and demand for it quite high and the US is responsible for 80 percent of the consumption of this endangered creature.  


Purple Mangosteen 
One forbidden fruit that you probably shouldn‚Äôt eat or at least be aware of is the purple mangosteen. This is a highly sought after fruit which which a delicacy in thailand must be destroyed completely if it‚Äôs found in the US! The problem isn‚Äôt that it‚Äôs a rare fruit or anything but the goal isr to keep the asian fruit fly out, which is responsible for complete destruction of some crops. The tropical species has already wreaked havoc on the state of Florida and we don‚Äôt want this thing in our country! It‚Äôs been notorious for attacking over 400 different species of fruits and vegetables.",Food

QE0x1DGqnR0,Friday lunchtime lecture: Why should the arts collide at CERN?,"In 2012, the same year that CERN discovered the Higgs boson, another experiment was underway that crossed more than just scientific frontiers: Arts@CERN.

Since 2011, when the first Collide residency awards were announced at the Ars Electronica Festival in Linz, there had not only been engineered collisions between protons at CERN, but also orchestrated collisions between artists and scientists.

So what does a curator add to a highly scientific and technological environment? Why are they necessary to make creative collisions happen and matter? These and many more questions will be answered in this Friday lunchtime lecture by Ariane Koek, founder of Arts@CERN, who initiated, created and designed this extensive multi-stranded international arts programme.

In 2008/9 Ariane Koek was awarded the Clore Fellowship and, as part of the award, initiated an ongoing attachment to CERN, the world‚Äôs largest particle physics laboratory based outside Geneva in Switzerland. Subsequently she became the first cultural specialist appointed by CERN in 2010 and created, designed and directed for nearly five years at the Arts@CERN international programme.

Koek is a Clore Fellow, independent international cultural strategy and policy consultant, producer, curator and writer. She is an external policy advisor to two directorates at the European Commission on arts, science and technology and also special advisor to Baltan Laboratories, Eindhoven, a multidisciplinary laboratory for artists working with technology.

Our travel and food in sikkim was fun, had great time in Gangtok...If you have any experience of Gangtok in terms of sightseeing or food, do share that in comments below‚Ä¶

Travelling cost:  Refer to EP 1 description section on how below cost is calculated.

Min cost to reach Gangtok: Rs 500.
Hotel: Rs 1500 per day.
Food Rs 500 one meal
Total cost of Day 0: Rs 2500

Day1 : Cab for local sightseeing  for 8 hours Rs 2500.
You may want to take share cab for point to point travelling but then you can't travel to all tourist destinations. 

Example from MG marg you can take a share cab for trolley point by paying Rs 20.. but you can't go to Hanuman Tok on share cab as on that route no share cab.,

OLA and uber taxi service not available.

you : can take cab for travelling from one point to another , but that's expensive they charge anything from Rs 200 to Rs 400...

Day 1 : 
cab : 2500
food 1000
hotel: 1500
Total cost of Day 1: Rs 5000.
Above cost will apply for Day 0 and Day 1 will be 2500 plus 5000 equals to 7500.

I paid much higher cost because i had exclusive taxi all the time, i stayed in 3 category hotel which was expensive.

The Pacific region is one of the most expansive regions on the planet, and has a huge amount of racial, ethnic and linguistic diversity as well, and it's one of the most interesting places to study.

Let me know your thoughts on the Pacific region, as well as leaving me a question for my 1K subs Q&A!

5SnR-e0S6Ic,Globalization I - The Upside: Crash Course World History #41,"In which John Green teaches you about globalization, a subject so epic, so, um, global, it requires two videos. In this video, John follows the surprisingly complex path of t-shirt as it criss-crosses the world before coming to rest on your doorstep, and eventually in your dresser. (Unless you're one of those people who never puts their laundry away and lives out of a laundry basket. If that's the case, shame on you.) Anyway, the story of the t-shirt and its manufacture in far-flung places like China, Guatemala, and India is a microcosm of what's going on in the global economy. Globalization is a bit of a mixed bag, and there have definitely been winners and losers along the way. In this episode John will talk about some of the benefits that have come along with it. Next week, he'll get into some of the less-positive side effects of globalization.

Also, you should turn on the captions.

The Best Street Food we found, was definitely the cemita sandwich from Puebla, which was made by the most amazing woman, the Sandwich Ninja of Mexico! The cemita sandwich was cut so fast with amazing skills, EXTREMELY fast! Her knife skills were incredible, chopping and cutting so fast with the avocado fruit and the chicken as well. The way her hands worked was amazing to watch, and this was just one of the street foods we had in Puebla, Mexico! The Chicken sandwich was so plump and delicious

We started our street food tour in Mexico in Mexico city, eating a ton of delicious street food in Part 1 and 2 here:

https://youtu.be/dHnqNOvDi44
https://youtu.be/W0Anp0wmXek

After this, we spent a day on a street food adventure to go to Puebla, all in search of the famous Mole poblano, but we found so much more.  The first thing we did was visit a local market and try out a bunch of food in the market, like juicy lamb tacos, covered in spicy salsa and then spicy stomach tortilla tacos as well. This is the beauty of Mexican street food, the amazing variation and extreme deliciousness of the cuisine that makes your mouth come alive. 

After those amazing Mexican tacos, we kept exploring the farmers market even more!

After this, we found the world famous Mexican Mole Poblano, famous from Puebla that was incredibly flavourful, full of chocolate, chilies, fruit, nuts, cinnamon, and more!

After exploring the street food market a little more, we drove to Puebla and found the most amazing sandwich ninja cutting up with super human skill each ingredient and fruit like avocado to put into the sandwich and slice with incredible speed and precision! She was so fast! The sandwich was prepared very fast and it was so delicious as well! She had GOD LEVEL skill, her knife skills were so fast and so fun to watch. 

After eating the sandwich with the locals and enjoying the flavour, we went on to have one final meal in Puebla, Mexico, except this one wasn't a street food. We wanted to try the stuffed chili pepper, but it wasn't in season! So we had a pumpkin seed sauce over top of pork and it was still fairly delicious.

Here are the addresses for the locations in this street food vlog:

1) Lamb Tacos with delicious spicy salsa - Inside the Cholula Farmers Market near the town square
2) Amazing Mexican salad bar featuring spicy pickled chipotle chilies and cow feet salad along with Nopales prickly pear cactus salad - Also inside the Cholula farmers market
3) Mole Poblano rich and dark chocolate sauce with chili, nuts, fruit, and cinnamon - Also found inside the cholula local farmers street food market
4) Super human fast cutting skills sandwich lady of Mexico - Found in Puebla downtown - Super Cemitas El As De Oros

ojj5J6oPwXo,GONZO: Manufacturing American dreams (E1),"As the USA descends into hyper-partisan civil war in which weaponized memes and hashtags are lobbed across political party lines, GONZO heads to Hollywood ‚Äì ground zero for the new culture wars. This is also where the myth of the American Dream is engineered, and where all her superheroes save the world. Max and Stacy meet with photographer, Peter Duke, who has been branded ‚Äòalt-right‚Äô by the mainstream media. They ask him about the power of memes to alter the course of history. Did a racist cartoon frog emerging from the darkest recesses of online chat boards really help defeat ‚Äòthe most qualified‚Äô presidential candidate in US history?

Max and Stacy also talk to a Hollywood screenwriter about which feature film characters best capture the essence of modern America, and about the real violence that is part of our DNA, from slavery to genocide of the native population. Max and Stacy also find Donald Trump‚Äôs star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, because ‚Äì of course ‚Äì it is Hollywood itself that created the myth that is the straight-talking, successful billionaire real-estate developer and builder for whom many voted to become president of the United States of America. The GONZO journey begins!

2jIbhRPCJG4,Google Glass on the Manufacturing Floor using Proceedix,"AGCO‚Äôs Jackson, Minnesota manufacturing team has incorporated Google Glass to audit finished product before it is shipped to dealers for consumer purchase.   Wearable technology allows the Quality team to thoroughly inspect tractors while improving standards in safety, checklist documentation, issue trending and throughput.  Although Glass still feels as futuristic of a technology as flying cars, AGCO has embraced the elaborate electronic devices, making use of voice activated commands and eye winks as daily tools.  In addition to the efficiency that voice and eye motion bring to the process, the simple fact that the quality technicians are no longer carrying devices, allowing for hands free inspection and focus on safety has increased throughput, safety records and checkpoint reliability.   Checklists are now smart, following model specifications and presenting instructional diagrams and text that drive the technician‚Äôs response and follow-up actions.  Every point on the checklists requires action and offers a level of detail that allows on the job training for newer employees and newly released model specifications. 
As Agricultural equipment companies continue to competitively advance their technologies to help farmers maximize their yield, the complexities to produce the machines increases.  As the world also continues to battle a shortage of skilled manufacturing workers, solutions like wearable technology, offering immediate access to instructions and information will become required.  The company‚Äôs that realize this and find solutions will be in positions to not only succeed in, but win, the global markets. #agcocorp",Manufacturing

‚ñ∫Subscribe - http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe
‚ñ∫T-shirts - https://migrationology.com/store/

Athens is a city that I‚Äôve  wanted to visit ever since learning so much about it during one of my Western Civilizations classes in High School. Finally, I had a chance to visit, not only for the  amazing history, but mainly for the amazing Greek food!

In this video, I‚Äôm taking you on a one day, all out Greek food tour of Athens along with Tassos. We ate a combination of classic Greek street food snacks, and a few restaurants, including for dinner some of the best lamb chops I‚Äôve ever had.

Here are all the restaurants and places included in this Greek food tour of Athens:

Dexameni Cafe - Our first stop was to drink Greek coffee in this small public square. A great environment, and the coffee was excellent.
Price - 1.80 EUR per cup

Kostarelos Deli - Tassos knows his Greek cheese and he says Kostarelos Deli has some of the best cheese in Athens.
Total price - 14.60 EUR

Mam - Mam is often considered the best Greek cheese pie in Athens, and it‚Äôs a  perfect street food kind of place. Most people take-away, but they have a standing table as well. The classic Greek cheese pie was my favorite.
Total price - 4.80 EUR

Varvakios Market - This is the Athens central market for meat and seafood. It‚Äôs a beautiful market and any lover would enjoy walking around this amazing market.

Miran - Pastourma and Soutzouki - This is a really cool little deli in Athens where you can buy for takeaway or order whatever you see and sit at one of the tables to snack. They are known for their camel pastirma, and it was the best thing we tried - absolutely excellent.
Total price - 4.62 EUR

Bougatsopoleio Thessaloniki - Bougatsa is a famous Greek food pastry. We tried a couple versions, but the best for me was the minced meat filled bougatsa. 
Total price -  15.50 EUR

Kostas Soulvaki - Souvlaki, also known as kalamaki is perhaps the best known of all Greek street food or Greek fast food, and Kostas is considered to be one of the best places to eat it in Athens. They grill pork, stuff it into Greek pita, top it with tomatoes, onions, and tomato sauce, and wrap it into a handheld treat. Amazing.
Price - 2.20 EUR per piece

Taverna To Trigono - For dinner, Tassos wanted to take us to one of his favorite restaurants in Athens, a little outside of the city in a place called Kalyvia Thorikou. This is a countryside meat paradise, and they served us some of the best lamb chops I‚Äôve ever had in my life. An amazing  meal to end an incredible day of Greek food in Athens.
Lamb chops
 Total price for everything - 99 EUR

Thank you for watching this Greek food tour of Athens!

Agora (Spanish: √Ågora) is a 2009 Spanish English-language historical drama film directed by Alejandro Amen√°bar and written by Amen√°bar and Mateo Gil. The biopic stars Rachel Weisz as Hypatia, a female mathematician, philosopher and astronomer in late 4th-century Roman Egypt, who investigates the flaws of the geocentric Ptolemaic system and the heliocentric model that challenges it. Surrounded by religious turmoil and social unrest, Hypatia struggles to save the knowledge of classical antiquity from destruction. Max Minghella co-stars as Davus, Hypatia's father's slave, and Oscar Isaac as Hypatia's student, and later prefect of Alexandria, Orestes.

The story uses historical fiction to highlight the relationship between religion and science amidst the decline of Greco-Roman polytheism and the Christianization of the Roman Empire. The title of the film takes its name from the agora, a gathering place in ancient Greece, similar to the Roman forum. The film was produced by Fernando Bovaira and shot on the island of Malta from March to June 2008. Justin Pollard, co-author of The Rise and Fall of Alexandria (2007), was the historical adviser for the film.

Agora was screened out of competition at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival in May, and opened in Spain on October 9, 2009 becoming the highest grossing film of the year for that country. Although the film had difficulty finding distribution, it was released country by country throughout late 2009 and early 2010. The film received a 53% overall approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes and seven Goya Awards in Spain, including Best Original Screenplay. It was awarded the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Feature Film Prize at the Hamptons International Film Festival.",History

Saving Private Ryan is a 1998 American epic war drama film set during the Invasion of Normandy in World War II. Directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Robert Rodat, the film is notable for its graphic portrayal of war, and for the intensity of its opening 27 minutes, which includes a depiction of the Omaha Beach assault of June 6, 1944. It follows United States Army Rangers Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and a squad (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg, and Jeremy Davies) as they search for a paratrooper, Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last-surviving brother of four servicemen.

The film received universal critical acclaim, winning several awards for film, cast, and crew, as well as earning significant returns at the box office. The film grossed US$481.8 million worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of the year. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated the film for 11 Academy Awards; Spielberg's direction won him a second Academy Award for Best Director, with four more awards going to the film. Saving Private Ryan was released on home video in May 1999, earning another $44 million from sales. In 2014, Saving Private Ryan was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry as it was deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.""",History

B9YtgV7R4qs,History Channel - Civilization Lost - Full History Documentary,"Around the world, archaeologists are uncovering artifacts that suggest the existence of previously unknown ancient civilizations, much like the mythical city of Atlantis. 

There is a growing belief among certain scientists and archaeologists that tens of thousands of years ago, before the rise of today's man, sophisticated human societies populated large cities that possibly featured mechanized transportation, electricity, and advanced weapons systems. Proponents of this theory believe that these civilizations were wiped off the planet and that the evidence now lies buried miles beneath the Earth's surface. This two-hour special will investigate these beliefs and uncover the truth about people who lived before the beginning of recorded time.

Lyrics


I got drunk and fell asleep atop the sheets but luckily i left the heater on.
And in my dreams i wrote the best song that i've ever written...can't remember how it goes.
I stayed drunk and fell awake and i was cycling on a plane and far away i heard you say you liked me.
We drifted to a party -- cool. The people went to arty school. They made their paints by mixing acid wash and lemonade

In my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your name

I found an ezra pound and made a bet that if i found a cigarette i'd drop it all and marry you.
Just then a song comes on: ""you can't always get what you want"" -- the rolling stones, oh woe is we, the irony!
The stones became the moss and once all inhibitions lost, the hipsters made a mission to the farm.
We drove by tractor there, the yellow straw replaced our hair, we laced the dairy river with the cream of sweet vermouth.

In my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your name

You said ""we only live once"" so we touched a little tongue, and instantly i wanted to...
I lost my train of thought and jumped aboard the Epping as the doors were slowly closing on the world.
I touched on and off and rubbed my arm up against yours and still the inspector inspected me.
The lady in the roof was living proof that nothing really ever is exactly as it seems.

In my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your name

We caught the river boat downstream and ended up beside a team of angry footballers.
I fed the ducks some krill then we were sucked against our will into the welcome doors of the casino.
We drank green margaritas, danced with sweet senoritas, and we all went home as winners of a kind.
You said ""i guarantee we'll have more fun, drink till the moon becomes the sun, and in the taxi home i'll sing you a triffids song!""

In my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your name",History

ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON
Hillary Clinton has served as Secretary of State, Senator from New York, First Lady of the United States, First Lady of Arkansas, a practicing lawyer and law professor, activist, and volunteer, but the first things her friends and family will tell you is that she‚Äôs never forgotten where she came from or who she‚Äôs been fighting for throughout her life. Hillary was raised in a suburb of Illinois where she attended public school and was raised a Methodist by her parents. She attended Wellesley College, and went on to study law at Yale. After attending Yale Law School, she went to work for the Children‚Äôs Defense Fund, going door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts. After serving as a lawyer for the Congressional Committee investigating President Nixon, she moved to Arkansas where she taught law and ran legal clinics representing poor people. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, one of the state‚Äôs first child advocacy groups. As First Lady under President Bill Clinton, Hillary tenaciously led the fight to reform our health care system so that all our families have access to the care they need at affordable prices. Hillary led the U.S. delegation to Beijing to attend the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and gave a groundbreaking speech, declaring that ‚Äúhuman rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all‚Äù‚Äîinspiring women worldwide and helping to galvanize a global movement for women‚Äôs rights and opportunities. Hillary was then elected to the U.S. Senate, becoming the first woman senator from New York.  She repeatedly worked across the aisle to get things done, including working alongside Republicans after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. When Congress wouldn't do enough for rural areas and small towns, Hillary didn‚Äôt back down. She launched innovative partnerships with the tech industry and provided support to local colleges and small businesses. When President Obama asked Hillary to serve as his secretary of state, she answered the call to public service once again. She was a forceful champion for human rights, internet freedom, and rights and opportunities for women and girls, LGBT people and young people all around the globe. Now she‚Äôs running for President because everyday Americans need a champion and she wants to be that champion.

How long did it take you to make this video? 
Short answer: Too Bleeping Long (well over 100 hours as I had to remake this)
(I started in around December and research before then) 

What software/equipment did you use to make this video?
After effects, Illustrator, Premier Pro, Audacity, Yeti microphone, 

Believe it or not this is in a nutshell compared to the amount of research that went into this 
Obviously we've simplified some events just for the sake of time and missed people and events that can be covered in other videos

Adapted from the eponymous Nicole Krauss‚Äô novel. New York, the 21st century. Leo, an old Polish Jewish immigrant, lives with
the memory of the great love of his life. Despite his painful history, he cheerfully navigates life‚Äôs ups and downs with indefatigable, crazy humor, alongside his best friend Bruno. Across town, in Brooklyn, teenage Alma is determined to find the ideal man for her mother to remarry. Always in control, she is staggered to find herself falling for her handsome classmate Misha, and discovering love for the first time. Nothing seems to link old Leo and young Alma. And yet‚Ä¶ From Poland in the 1930s to Ellis Island; from Chile to Central Park, the manuscript of ‚Äúthe most loved woman in the world‚Äù will travel through time to unite their destinies.",History

PdsJs0UIm7s,"HISTORY OF RELIGION (Part 1): PAGANS, NIMROD, &amp; BABYLON","In order to understand the many lies that have given to us over time, we must be educated on the truth.  A main part of my ministry is to educate so that lies can be truly seen and bondage be broken.  Many people are against Christianity for many reasons, but one of the biggest reasons is they don't understand the history behind it.  So my next series of videos will be educating my viewers on the history of religion. In an effort to keep the time down, it's just a summary so if there is something left out or that you don't understand leave it in the comments and I will try to answer if I can.  I hope this blesses whoever watched.  The Lord says his people suffer for a lack of knowledge and my goal is to try and stop the suffering.

A note on 'Ivan the Terrible' - in Russia, Ivan IV has the epithet '–ì—Ä–æÃÅ–∑–Ω—ã–π' meaning 'Great' or 'Formidable'. So why is he known as Ivan 'the Terrible' in English? Because he was evil or useless or because of anti-Russian bias? No, because 'Terrible' in English also means awesome or formidable - this was well understood when '–ì—Ä–æÃÅ–∑–Ω—ã–π' was first translated into English centuries ago, but now fewer people understand this. (see definitions 3 & 4 here: http://www.dictionary.com/browse/terr...). The name stuck, and Ivan IV has been known as Ivan the Terrible ever since.

Jk3iOqKOD7g,History Summarized: Africa,"THE DANGER OF A SINGLE STORY: https://youtu.be/D9Ihs241zeg

It's been brought to my attention that I made two mistakes: 1) Yes, I disappear at 18:26. Not sure how that happened. 2) At 12:25 I use a map of Africa that with some weird borders. That's my bad. But if you look at a legit map of Africa, you'll see the same straight lines in the places that I marked them.
(Remember: making mistakes is ok, so long as we learn from them)

The Epic of Mwindo sure was cool, huh? This video is here to show you all about the lovely continent that it came from: Africa! And BOY are there a lot of misconceptions about it.

jvYTiPQAyAE,How art and music create a new hybrid global culture: Rajae El Mouhandiz at TEDxBreda,"The ""one story"" of Muslims and immigrants we hear in the news and politics every day is ignoring the many stories of millions of women and men who do not see themselves in that old story, but as authors and owners of a new story where globalism and hybrid cultures are the stage and vehicle. They represent a new story of being and belonging in the world. A story where history is honoured as the sacrifices of those who came before us. Their parents moved to the west to start something new, mixed with the old, and individuals like Rajae El Mouhandiz are the product. As the new stories they are shaping do not yet have a language and a platform, one has to start telling the stories through art and music. And personal strength.

Regarding Rajae El Mouhandiz
Rajae El Mouhandiz is a Dutch-Moroccan-Algerian poet, singer, composer, producer, and founder of the record label Truthseeker Records. After leaving her family at age 15 and being the first Moroccan to study at a Dutch conservatory at age 16. El Mouhandiz left classical music at age 20 to follow her own artistic path, seeking to incorporate her cultural roots. She started her own record label at age 25, released two albums and is currently developing her third album in Morocco. On international women's day 2013 El Mouhandiz premiered her first short documentary film, about the acceptance of Muslim women in mainstream media and the music industry. Currently she is developing her second short film, focusing on her Maghreb heritage and the story of her grandfathers. She is also one of the 60 female curators of the groundbreaking international MUSLIMA exhibition, held in The USA, The Philipines, The U.A.E and Denmark. And together with the British Council Ireland and a Dutch theatre production company, El Mouhandiz is producing the Dutch and European version of the Hijabi Monologues; a theatre space for the experiences of Muslim women; a space to breathe as they are; a space that does not claim to tell every story and speak for every voice. The Dutch premiere is planned in September 2014. Rajae was nominated as Muslim Leader of tomorrow in 2005. She was nominated by Elsevier magazine as one of Hollands' 10 biggest talents in 2007, in the field of contemporary music and from 2009 -- 2012 she was the only female contemporary artist to be nominated on the list of the 500 most influential Muslims in the world. This year Rajae has been nominated for the 5th year in a row. More information: www.rajae.net",Art and Music

AaRW50ZSqmk,How is Europe manufacturing the ITER Toroidal Field coils?,"The ITER burning plasma is expected to reach 150 million ¬∞C. How are we going to confine it?
18 powerful superconducting magnets, known as Toroidal Field coils, will be powered with 68 000 A to generate a magnetic field of 11.8 Tesla (approximately 1 million times stronger the magnetic fields of the Earth!). In this ‚Äúcage‚Äù we will entrap the energy of a small sun.
Europe will manufacture ten of the TF coils and Japan will produce eight plus one spare. They will be the biggest Niobium-tin (Nb3Sn) magnets ever produced. More than 600 people from 26 companies have collaborated with F4E, managing the European contribution to ITER, to produce the ten TF coils.",Manufacturing

_qhIT8sOymk,How Long Foods Stay In Your Stomach,"How long does the process of digestion last? Do you find yourself still hungry no matter how much you eat? If so, you might be eating foods that are too high on the glycemic index. It‚Äôs definitely something worth knowing if you‚Äôre struggling with excess weight. 

 The glycemic index is a system of values given to foods according to how quickly they cause an increase in blood glucose levels. To put that in layman‚Äôs terms, it basically measures how fast different foods are digested by the body. Glucose is a simple sugar that gives your body energy, and you get it from the foods you eat.

Your blood is what carries this sugar throughout your body to all your hungry cells and tissues. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called blood glucose. If you eat something that‚Äôs high on the index, your blood glucose will spike, giving you a fast boost of energy.

TIMESTAMPS: 
What glycemic index is 0:58
Foods that digest slowly 3:30
Foods that digest moderately 4:08
Foods that digest quickly 4:34 
Foods that don‚Äôt have a glycemic index value 5:27
What about pizza? 6:09 
Are all low-glycemic foods healthy? 6:43

Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/

SUMMARY: 
- The glycemic index is a system of values given to foods according to how quickly they cause an increase in blood glucose levels. To put that in layman‚Äôs terms, it basically measures how fast different foods are digested by the body.
- If you eat something that‚Äôs high on the index, your blood glucose will spike, giving you a fast boost of energy.
- Foods and drinks are actually split into three groups: low, medium, and high. Low items rate from 1 to 55, medium is from 56 to 69, and high items are from 70 and above.
- According to the experts at Bodytomy, some low-glycemic foods, like cooked vegetables or a salad, can remain in your stomach anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour.
- There are also foods that really don‚Äôt really have a glycemic index value since they don‚Äôt contain any carbs. But they can still take a while to be digested by your stomach. It can take you anywhere from 2 to 5 hours for your stomach to digest meats, like chicken, lamb, and pork.
- If you‚Äôre having pizza that‚Äôs just dough, cheese, and sauce, that might rate high on the glycemic index, mostly because of that dough. But believe it or not, adding toppings actually makes your slice healthier!
- You might encounter foods that will be low on the index, but if they‚Äôre processed, they most likely still contain tons of saturated fats, sugar, and empty calories.

P5kHf0LhIm8,How to be Creative - Developing Creativity - Art Music Writing etc.,"How to be Creative - Developing Creativity and Productivity - Art Music Writing etc.

In this video, I talk about how to be creative and create better projects by using two different types of thinking. For creative insights, I recommend what I call creative mod. Then, when you actually create, you go into editing mode. But it's important not to mix up these two thought processes.

Creativity and productivity are the two things needed to create a work of art. Many people spend forever in creative mode where new creative insights come up, but they never develop the productivity skills to bring those ideas to the world. On the other side, there are people who have created such a rigid system for creation that the editing related tasks completely nullify the ability for creative insights to come about. 

This process should work with many different art forms including but not limited to:

Drawing
Painting
Sculpture
Writing 
Video Creation
Animation
Design
Film
Music

tTWIIhKI8cA,How to Design and Manufacture a Product,"It can be quite a challenge to find a manufacturer -- one you like working with and whose factory produces a quality product at a fair price. Here are some tips on how to navigate through the process of finding one, as well as how to optimize your relationship with your manufacturer so that you -- and your customers -- are happy. For more infor visit: http://www.focuspdm.com/


Step 1: Creating a Prototype

Creating a working prototype or finding someone who can do it for you is the first step in the manufacturing process. During my early days, I was able to sew most of my prototypes. But as my product, Planecomfort, was refined and the components used and the skills necessary to create the product I envisioned moved beyond my sewing expertise, I knew I needed help. Searching online, I found a wonderful yet small cut-and-sew business in northern California called Left in Stitches.
This relationship proved valuable to me in a number of ways. They not only helped refine my original prototype, but they offered many suggestions and ideas for making the product easier to manufacture. Many of these smaller domestic companies offer prototyping services that are invaluable to new entrepreneurs.
Once you have a prototype, there is quality and design testing and tweaking. At each stage of development, and every time I received the newer version of my product, I washed, dried, pulled, stretched, zipped, unzipped, and put my product through the proverbial ""ringer."" Making sure your product will exceed your customers' expectations is a sure way to keep them coming back and referring your product to others.
Ideally, you want to have a dozen or so finished prototypes. Manufacturers will want one or two samples sent to them as a reference to compare to the finished product their factory is making.
I thought I would be able to use Left in Stitches for the long term, but due to logistical reasons and production costs, I had to find an overseas manufacturer. Moving your manufacturing operations overseas means you want large quantities (usually thousands) of the item you are producing. If you want hundreds of something, you may be better off working with a domestic manufacturer.
Step 2: Finding a Manufacturer

I located my overseas manufacturers through referrals, which provided me with an immediate level of comfort and confidence with these factories. One referral came from a fabric manufacturer. Most fabric manufacturers have relationships with product manufacturers.
Another factory was referred to me by a marketing services company. This company manufactures both soft and hard goods and was happy to provide their contact with another business opportunity. Call domestic manufacturers and inquire about their overseas connections. Ask everyone you know if they know someone who manufactures the type of products you are creating. Search online for companies with products similar to yours and call them. Who do they use? How did they get started? My experience is that most people will want to help you.
I found it was best to work with at least two different companies when trying to decide who will win your business. Who is easiest to work with? Who meets (or beats) your expectations? Is one more knowledgeable than the other? Having a comparison is essential to ensure you are getting a quality product at a fair price.
There are two common ways you can deal with overseas manufacturing. You can find a broker or agent in the U.S. that represents the factory, or deal with a factory directly.

Once you have determined who you might like to work with, you must check references on your contact and the factory. Some of the important questions to ask:
Was the product made to specifications?
What percentage of the shipment was defective?
If there was a problem with the shipment, did the factory make restitution?
Were deadlines met? If not, what did the factory offer to make amends?
Is what was promised delivered?
How is the quality of goods they produce?
How long have you worked with this person and factory?
How many orders have you placed?
Is your contact easy to work with?
Is he/she responsive to calls and emails?
What type of projects does the factory excel in producing? Soft goods, hard goods?
What types of companies do they normally work with?
Who is responsible for landing the goods in the U.S.?

In this video Stefan shows you step by step how to find wholesale suppliers and manufacturers to private label a product and sell on Amazon.

""This is a very important step of this process because once you found a product that you want to sell or a niche or an opportunity that you want to sell on Amazon that you already deemed as profitable that you can make money from then the supplier piece is the next most important part.

You want to make sure that you find suppliers that have good prices, that will give you a great quote, that you can negotiate with and build a great relationship with, that you can order a certain number of units from, maybe a product from China or the United States. 

I will be showing you exactly how to do that.""

subeIZgLquI,How To Make A T-Shirt From Design To Manufacturing Process,"In this video I show you how to make a t-shirt from the design to manufacturing process. It starts with designing a shirt, pattern making, sewing, cutting and then goes into large production manufacturing. More from Bella Canvas: http://bit.ly/2t9Guo6 

When starting a clothing line it's important to know the process, and this video is a great way to learn what it takes to create a t-shirt from scratch. 

Sign up to the newsletter and receive free downloads to help grow your business + enter to win upcoming giveaways:  http://bit.ly/Apparel-Download 

The following steps can be applied to make any product, so feel free to jot down notes and reference this section for future use. 

Step 1: T-Shirt Design 
The first step to making a t-shirt involves the design sketch. Create a sketch that depicts the angles and details you'd like the final shirt to have. It doesn't have to be super fancy, as long as you can show what you need. Designing a shirt with the end goal in mind helps the pattern maker know what you are going for. Thanks you Torey Lewitz for joining us.

Step 2: Pattern Making
Once the designs are completed, you will consult with a pattern maker to bring your clothing line to life. The pattern maker will take your designs and create ‚Äúpatterns‚Äù which are the pieces that will be cut and sewn together. 

Step 3: Sample Cutting
Once the patterns are completed, they are printing on a plotter that creates the outline for the sample cutter. The person in charge of cutting the sample will follow the guides to ensure the pieces are cut to the right specifications. Castle Notches allow the person in charge of sewing to close the product up right. 

Step 4: Sewing The T-Shirt
After the fabric is cut out, it is ready to be sewn. The cut pieces are now the shape of the patterns and multiple sewing machines are used to finish the design. The final outcome is hopefully what you envisioned. But more than likely it won‚Äôt be the final fit, so you will repeat the process until you are happy with the size, fit and shape of your apparel line. 

Step 5: Mass Production Cutting
As soon as the shirt or apparel design you created is approved, the patterns are finalized and sent into the production process. John Chacon Head Of Production walks us through his process. 

Step 6: Mass Production Sewing 
Once the pieces are all cut out, they are sent to the sewing factory. The factory is given the cut fabric and the head of production is in charge of making sure everyone knows what their role is. 

Step 7: Order Fulfillment/ Clothing Line Distribution
The last step in this video is the order fulfillment and distribution of the finished clothing. As a clothing business you also have to think about how you will provide quicker shipping, handle returns and manage employees. Randy Pinter Head of Warehouse Distribution drops the knowledge on what it takes to run this facility.

#NAME?,How To Make Travel Videos That People Actually Watch,"10 tips for how to make travel videos that are fun, informative, and entertaining.  I often get asked how I make my travel videos, and I‚Äôll be sharing my process.  I‚Äôll start with ideas, research, writing the script, filming, to ultimately editing and putting the video on Youtube.  No discussion of drone shots here! Follow Yellow Productions on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/yellowwproductions/

1 - Coming up with an idea
 Starts with a trip ‚Äî where am I going?  What other videos have I made?  Whats interesting at this destination?  What else have people already done?
 I have some ‚Äúclassic‚Äù themes, 10 things to know, cheap eats, how to ride public transit

 If its an idea for a live stream ‚Äî then its something I can talk about for an hour, and hopefully something that encourages dialogue.

2 - Research
 To make an informative travel guide (or even just have a good trip) requires research.  Youtube, Wikitravel, Blogs, trip advisor, Flyertalk, and even books.  Rick Steves are my favorite for Europe.  I put this all in to a few documents in Google Drive/Google Docs.

3 - Writing the ‚Äúscript‚Äù
 Nobody wants to watch a constant stream of consciousness‚Ä¶  it has to be a story.  So this is where some more ‚Äúthinking‚Äù comes in, as to how to weave whatever in to an interesting story, with a beginning, middle, and end.  Even if it‚Äôs ‚Äú10 cheap eats‚Äù or ‚Äú10 things to know‚Äù ‚Äî there has to be an order to those things.

 Usually a bulleted list of notes.

 Destinations I‚Äôll put the name, address, ‚Äúneighborhood‚Äù, Subway stop, website link.  Sometimes pictures.

 The things I really want to go to, I put in to Google Maps as a ‚Äústar‚Äù or a ‚Äúheart‚Äù

4 - Preparing equipment for the video

 Camera, Batteries, More Batteries, Microphone, Lens Cleaner

 2nd Camera?  Go Pro?  360 Camera?  External Audio Recorder?  Lights?
 
 Tripod, Gorillapod, Selfie Stick

5 - Prepping to roll on scene

 Not always in order that you see it.  And often not a flow in the same video. Might shoot one clip of one video, and another clip of another video back to back.

 Review my notes before the scene.

 Find a good angle where you can see me, and whatever I‚Äôm talking about, not noisy, OK lighting, won‚Äôt bug too many people, where can I put my tripod?  Where won‚Äôt security hassle me.

 Is the sun bad?  Might have to come back at a different time of day

6 - Shooting the main scene

 Lights, Camera, Action!

 I try to pretend it‚Äôs a conversation, just with a piece of glass instead of a real person.

 Often requires multiple takes.  Might even redo the same blurb in different locations.  Make sure audio was capture, and that it is understandable

 Standing shots, Walking Shots, Walk on to the shot, Walk off the shot, Intros, Conclusions

 Always make sure to get a few extra seconds of video at the beginning and at the end

7 - Shooting B Roll

 This is the stuff I insert on top of me talking so it‚Äôs not always me.

 Steady shots.  Pan shots.  Time lapse shots.  Something that would be interesting.  I always capture WAY more B-Roll than I use.  

 Sometimes this has to be as a picture, because pulling out my camcorder would be too noticeable.

8 - Downloading the video

 So I come home, I transfer all the video off my camera, phone, etc.  To 2 different computers that way I‚Äôve always got a backup.

 I generally use Sony/Magix Vegas for Windows.  Or Final Cut Pro for mac if I‚Äôm traveling

 Then I categorize all the video shot in to groups: topics/destinations, what video it will be in, scenic shots (B roll). Delete the stuff that just isn‚Äôt good.  

9 - Let the editing begin!


10 - Render and upload

kibUalgXIIY,How to order food in Spanish,"If you want to eat out in a Spanish speaking country or just practice your Spanish language skills when you go out to dinner, you need this quick and easy Spanish lesson! Learn common phrases for speaking with your waiter in Spanish.


Transcript of How to order food in Spanish:

Let‚Äôs be honest, one of the best things to do while in Latin America or Spain is eat! In this video we are going to review some useful expressions you will need while in a restaurant.
--------------------------------------------------------
Cut screen: Talking with your server

To be able to successfully order food and drinks in a restaurant you will need to first understand the common exchange between a waiter and a customer. Here are some typical questions you might hear and some  appropriate responses.

Cut screen: Ordering food
------------------------------------------------------
When ordering food:

It is common for a waiter to say: Can I take your order? ‚Üí ¬øLes tomo la orden?

You could answer: The enchiladas, please. ‚Üí Las enchiladas por favor.


Another way a waiter might ask for your order is: What would you like to eat? ‚Üí ¬øQu√© desean comer?

You might answer: I would like the chicken and rice, please. ‚Üí Quisiera el pollo con arroz por favor.

Cut screen:  Ending your meal
------------------------------------------------------
At the end of your meal, you will need to ask for the check.

The waiter may ask: Can I offer you anything else? ‚Üí ¬øLes puedo ofrecer algo mas?
Or he might ask: Would you like a dessert or coffee? ‚Üí ¬øDesean algo de postre o caf√©?

Cut screen:  Requesting your check
------------------------------------------------------

You could answer: No thank you. The check please. ‚Üí No gracias. La cuenta por favor.

Or you could say: No thank you. Could you please bring us the check? ‚Üí No gracias. ¬øNos puede traer la cuenta por favor?

Cut screen:  Enjoy eating out!
------------------------------------------------------
By familiarizing yourself with these expressions, you will be ready to enjoy all the great restaurants in Spain and Latin America.",Food

ZU8ji-yi5Zk,How to Travel Cheap to Japan: 10 Money Saving Tips,"10 tips on how to travel to Japan without breaking your wallet! Many people think Japan is an expensive destination, but that is totally not true!  It is very easy to travel to Japan for cheap.  Tips include: Cheap flights to Japan, cheap trains in Japan, and of course: Cheap Eats in Japan.  So how cheap am I talking about? Staying in a hostel, buying a rail pass, eating relatively cheap food, and visiting a few attractions will cost around $100 USD per day

1 - Travel off peak: Cherry blossom and autumn foliage times (usually around early April and mid-November, respectively) are peak season for Japanese travelers, meaning peak hotel rates.  Watch out for Japan-Only Holidays: Golden Week and Obon (April 29 to May 5 and around mid-August, respectively

2 - Airports:  Fly in to some place other than Tokyo.  Osaka -- flights to Osaka are often $200 cheaper than flights to Tokyo.  And it‚Äôs right next to Kyoto.  And go to Nara to feed the deer!  Nagoya (home of Toyota) often has really cheap flights too (Like $450/round trip)

3 - Getting to the city from the airport: Don‚Äôt take a taxi.  It can be like $200 from Narita to Tokyo.  Take a Limousine bus or NEX for about 3,000 Yen, or the Keisei Line from Narita for about 1300 Yen (slower equals cheaper).  Buy a combination ticket, NEX plus Suica card.  Similar combos in Osaka.

4- Getting around
Tokyo subways starts at 160 Yen, or about $1.50 US.  Many cities often sell day passes for 600-1000 Yen.

JR Pass: 7-Day is 29,110 Yen.  Good for Tokyo to Kyoto/Osaka round trip.  Osaka to Tokyo each way is about 14,000 Yen.  Buy online before you go, save about 20%.

Look for local JR Passes for a particular region or special offers like the Seishun 18 for only 11,850 for 5 days.  Seishun 18 allows unlimited rides on local and rapid JR trains (excluding reserved seats) throughout Japan from Hokkaido in the north to Kyushu in the south. Although the Seishun 18 is not valid on Shinkansens and limited express trains, it is a great way to enjoy travel at a more leisurely pace. This ticket package includes five days worth of travel for only 2,370 yen per day. One person can enjoy the Seishun 18 for five days, or it can be split for use by up to five people.

Get the Kansai Through Pass if you are in Osaka/Kyoto, 5,200 yen for 3 days unlimited transit.

5-Bus
Long distance buses: Overnight buses will be slower than the Shinkansen, but can save quite a bit.  Particularly if you can sleep on them.  Tokyo to Osaka by bus is 10 hours, and 4,500 Yen.  

Willer Express Bus offers a ¬•10,000 3-trip pass and a ¬•15,000 5-trip pass (~$100 and $150 USD respectively). These 3 and 5 travel trips (referred to as ‚Äúdays‚Äù on the site) can be used anytime, non-consecutively within a 2-month window

6 - Bicycle:  Many cities have metropolitan bike rental programs.  Takamatsu city rents bikes for 200 yen per day!  2,000 yen for a whole month.


7 - Shopping
Tax-Free Shopping: 8% refund for purchases over 5,000 yen at the same store.  Refund at the store.

100 Yen Shops: Like Daiso. Cheap gifts!

8 - Hotels:  
Business Hotels (Toyoko Inn, 7,500 Yen a night in Shinjuku)
[Stay more nights get a discount]
[Book in advance get a discount]
Capsule Hotels (3,000 Yen for a night, sometimes only men)
Hostels (2,000 a night -- but maybe free if you clean for a few hours)
Love Hotels (8000 Yen a night.. Stay at a business hotel instead)
Manga Cafes (100 yen for 30 minutes, 900-1500 yen for three hours and 1,600-3,000 yen for 7- to 12-hour packages)
Mcdonalds (the price of a meal)

Onsen/Hotspring:  Use a public bathhouse -- Often 500 Yen.

9 - Food:  Watch my cheap eats in Tokyo video.  Osaka Ohsho for Gyoza.  Yoshinoya for beef bowls.  Mos Burger for burgers.  Sushi at rotating sushi places.

Visit high-end restaurants at lunch for lunch specials.  No tipping.

10 - Attractions:  Multi-attraction passes, sometimes combined with transportation cost
Visit temples for free
Rooftop observation decks (Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building in Shinjuku)

Bonus: Money Exchange: At an ATM -- 7-11.

Cd2ch4XV84s,HOW World War I Started: Crash Course World History 209,"In which John Green teaches you about World War I and how it got started. Crash Course doesn't usually talk much about dates, but the way that things unfolded in July and August of 1914 are kind of important to understanding the Great War. You'll learn about Franz Ferdinand, Gavrilo Pincep, the Black Hand, and why the Serbian nationalists wanted to kill the poor Archduke. You'll also learn who mobilized first and who exactly started the war. Sort of. Actually there's no good answer to who started the war, but we give it a shot anyway.

You can directly support Crash Course at https://www.patreon.com/crashcourse Subscribe for as little as $0 to keep up with everything we're doing. Free is nice, but if you can afford to pay a little every month, it really helps us to continue producing this content.",History

LxnVCdzM9B8,Huge DEEP FRIED River Shrimp - Thai Food at Legendary Kui Mong (‡∏Å‡∏∏‡πà‡∏¢‡∏´‡∏°‡∏á) Restaurant!,"Watch more from Bangkok food tour: https://youtu.be/V3JiWEX81hU
Best of Bangkok food tour with The Hungry Tourist: https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry.tourist/

During the Best of Bangkok Food Tour with The Hungry Tourist (https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry.tourist/) and Puppup (https://www.instagram.com/puppup_foodlife/), one day for lunch we drove out to Kui Mong (‡∏Å‡∏∏‡πà‡∏¢‡∏´‡∏°‡∏á), a legendary restaurant that is the original restaurant in Thailand serving deep fried river shrimp (prawns).

In order to get the largest size, Puppup had to actually call the restaurant to order them one month in advance. If you just walk in you can get 400 or 600 gram shrimp probably, but the 800 gram single shrimp are hard to come by these days in Thailand.

Kui Mong (‡∏Å‡∏∏‡πà‡∏¢‡∏´‡∏°‡∏á) is very well known among Thais, mainly because most restaurant grill their river shrimp, but Kui Mong (‡∏Å‡∏∏‡πà‡∏¢‡∏´‡∏°‡∏á) is the first to deep fry them, and serve them in a ridiculously delicious oily shrimp sauce. The sauce is one of the greatest things you‚Äôll ever taste on rice, combined with more chili garlic sauce and an alternating bite of succulent river shrimp.

They owners family are very nice, but unfortunately since it‚Äôs such a secret recipe, we weren‚Äôt able to see the cooking - so that‚Äôs why this is just a short extra Thai food video - only showing the massive deep fried Thai river shrimp and eating them.

Price - 2,000 THB ($63.44), per 800 grams shrimp

Kui Mong (‡∏Å‡∏∏‡πà‡∏¢‡∏´‡∏°‡∏á)

Ting Ting and I (Trevor James, The Food Ranger), made our way to Vietnam solely to eat street food. Since we love street food around the world, we decided that Vietnam was the perfect holiday destination for street food to try, because it's supposed to be the best and we love watching new street food recipes and street food flavors as we adventure down deep, back alleyways, getting lost into new street food worlds.  So far, in our Vietnamese street food tour series, we've eaten street food in Hanoi, and then we took the sleeper train south 12 hours to Hue. Hue is the old ancient capital of Vietnam, and is packed full of different street food to try. We spent 4 days here eating and couldn't get enough of all the street food. Asian street food is the best, and in Vietnam, it doesn't get any better!

We found 11 different Vietnamese street foods in this video. If you arrive here looking to eat, you can follow along with these addresses:

1) Bun Bo hue @02:44- The specialty street food Beef and pork broth noodle soup of Hue, Vietnam - It‚Äôs absolutely rich and delicious! Found at the Dong Ba market early morning around 730am. Go to the outside of the street market and find the old ladies with big pots of good street food and you‚Äôll discover a ton!
2) Bun Hen @ 06:10 Spicy Clam noodle soup - Also found at the Dong Ba Market in Hue, Vietnam, in the early morning! Just look around the outside of the market, the perimeter, not on the inside.
3) Banh Tam Banana Leaf @ 09:44 wrapped around marinated shrimp - Found directly beside the Bun Hen at Dong Ba market
4) Veg Soup @ 11:27 - Also found at Dong Ba Street Food Market in Hue, Vietnam
5) Bun Tith Nuong @ 14:37 Grilled pork over top of rice noodles. These was my favorite meal from Hue, and so cheap at 10,000 Vietnamese dong! Bun Thit Nuong 66 B·∫°ch ƒê·∫±ng
6) Banh Mi Vietnamese Sandwich @ 17:55- This one was quite average. But still fun to eat! This one was at the intersection of Xuan 68 and Le Thanh Ton street inside Hue‚Äôs old city.
7) Douhua Silken Tofu @ 21:27 - This was a street food vendor carrying the food on wooden poles, so you have to be lucky at the right place at the right time. We were at the location below around 4:30 PM and she came along.
8) Banh Tran Truong ‚ÄúVietnamese Pizza made from rice paper‚Äù @ 22:54. You can find this one inside the old city on 14 Le Thanh Ton Street in Hue, Vietnam
9) Banh Ep - Flattened rice paper dough with raw egg grilled @ 22:54 - Same location as the Vietnamese rice paper pizza

 We found a bunch of unique and delicious Vietnamese street foods that you really need to try, all around Hanoi's old quarter! Despite this area being quite tourist, we found a lot of delicious food, so far, this has been the BEST street food city I've visited in Southeast asia!

In this Vietnam Street Food tour video, Myself (Trevor James, The Food Ranger), am taking you on a food street journey to many delicious, mouthwatering street food places around Hanoi in Northern Vietnam. If you're deciding whether or not to travel to Vietnam for the street food, you really need to come visit Hanoi. You can enjoy unique Vietnamese street foods hidden in Hanoi's old quarter alleyways and try classic Vietnam cuisine specialties like Pho for Breakfast, Bun Cha for lunch, A ton of different rice noodle dishes, and a ton of other hidden delights.

 Over the past 3 years,  I've filmed and eaten street food around China, including locations like Chengdu, Lanzhou, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Beijing, Wuhan, Leshan, Shanghai, and Xinjiang's Silk Road. So far, the street food in each of these locations has been the best street food around the world! BUT, I haven't shot a ton of street food in Southeast Asia, so we made it our goal to come to Vietnam to try the street foods. So far, it has totally been worth it!
 
Vietnamese cuisine is so delicious, and even though I've only been here a short while, I'm sure that it would really need a lifetime to eat all of it. I've decided to stay living in China, and move around to other countries like Vietnam for another year or two or even more, shooting delicious street food in china for you and across asia as well!

Here are the addresses and locations and restaurant names for the Vietnam street food I had in this Hanoi, Vietnam travel video. Most locations were deep in Hanoi's old quarter alleyways!

Kslh8XUphJo,IACMI Wind Blade Prototype (Composites Manufacturing Innovation),"Knoxville, TN, January 31, 2017‚Äî The Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation (IACMI) unveiled an advanced technology prototype wind blade during the Winter IACMI members meeting February 1-2 in Denver, Colorado. The nine- meter long blade was fabricated at IACMI‚Äôs Wind Technology Area in the Denver, Colorado area. Commercialization of the wind blade prototype created could speed production times, reduce manufacture cost, and provide stronger, more energy-efficient blades for the United States.

A large team of eleven industrial partners, including Arkema Inc., Johns Manville, TPI Composites Inc., Huntsman Polyurethanes, Strongwell, DowAksa USA, Chomarat North America, Composites One, SikaAxson, Creative Foam and Chem-Trend, provided materials and on site fabrication support for blade component manufacturing and assembly. Pultruded spar caps were fabricated at Strongwell in Bristol, Virginia and shipped to Colorado for incorporation into the blade shells. The project was led by IACMI‚Äôs Wind Technology Area, based in the Denver, Colorado area , with support from IACMI Headquarters, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the U.S. Department of Energy‚Äôs Advanced Manufacturing Office, and the Advanced Industries Program administered by the Colorado Office of Economic Trade and Development (OEDIT).

The prototype blade is based on an existing design from previous work conducted by the DOE, representing a small-scale version of a utility-scale multi-megawatt blade. The new blade, molded on tooling supplied by TPI Composites, Inc., features innovations such as impact resistant components, continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic parts and exterior shell components produced with less than half the normal CO2 emissions commonly emitted in wind blade manufacture.",Manufacturing

alJaltUmrGo,Imperialism: Crash Course World History #35,"In which John Green teaches you about European Imperialism in the 19th century. European powers started to create colonial empires way back in the 16th century, but businesses really took off in the 19th century, especially in Asia and Africa. During the 1800s, European powers carved out spheres of influence in China, India, and pretty much all of Africa. While all of the major (and some minor) powers in Europe participated  in this new imperialism, England was by far the most dominant, once able to claim that the ""sun never set on the British Empire."" Also, they went to war for the right to continue to sell opium to the people of China. Twice. John will teach you how these empires managed to leverage the advances of the Industrial Revolution to build vast, wealth-generating empires. As it turns out, improved medicine, steam engines, and better guns were crucial in the 19th century conquests. Also, the willingness to exploit and abuse the people and resources of so-called ""primitive"" nations was very helpful in the whole enterprise.

Z61Uii5K2j8,Improve Operator Efficiency - Manufacturing,"Measuring and improving operator efficiency of machines and equipment on the shopfloor can have a dramatic effect on manufacturing productivity and output.

PlantRun systems can be used to measure, track and analyse individual operator performance and compare the performance of machine operators against time/machine/product etc.. This allows you to identify under performing staff for re-training and to spread the best practices of your most efficient staff thereby improving operator efficiency.

Improved Time Management

Operators starting late, taking extra time during breaks, finishing early and taking longer to restart a machine than they should is a typical scenario in many manufacturing companies.

Even if  this is only arriving at the machine 5 minutes late, starting up 5 minutes later, taking an extra 10 minutes over lunchtime and then finishing 10 minutes early it amounts to 30 minutes in an 8 hour shift equivalent to 6.25%. Without continuous monitoring in place this is often much longer. And this is per machine, if you have 20 machines you are losing 10 man hours per shift!

Maybe you don't think your staff do this, but until you measure breaks accurately you don't really know. For one PlantRun user a ""ten minute"" break period was reduced from 23 minutes down to 13 minutes upon installation of the system!

Increasing Operator Productivity

An example of increased operator productivity comes from a wire fabrication company producing a wide range of goods including roll containers, stillages, pallet converters, dollies, picking trollies and garment rails.

The company employ a core staff of around 100 staff but at peak production times this number can double with low skilled agency staff. The productivity of temporary staff is variable and with a relatively labour intensive production process maximising operator output is vital. All the fabrication machinery is monitored for machine utilization efficiency.

Operators log on to the system at shift start up and the system monitors run time, stop time and reasons for stoppage. By analysing downtime stoppages problems such as extended operator breaks are identified and addressed.

System reports make it easy to identify operators with poor productivity performance for training or replacement.  A typical reported improvement in operator productivity boosted output per shift from 80 to 94 units, an increase of 17.5%.

Improved Motivation

Staff motivation can be improved in two ways.

Firstly, the data collected by the system can be used to keep staff informed of their performance against target production rates either using the keypad terminals or large shopfloor displays.  Goal setting and competition between work groups or cells can significantly improve motivation and output.

Secondly, the awareness that production is being monitored and the understanding that computers can't lie often have a refreshing effect on staff behavioural patterns and bad practices that may have been formed over time. In some cases dramatic improvements in productivity have been recorded before systems have been fully installed, simply from improving operator efficiency.",Manufacturing

__________________________
Narrated by David Ackroyd

Charles Ponzi became known in the early 1920s as a swindler in North America for his money-making scheme. He promised clients a 50% profit within 45 days, or 100% profit within 90 days, by buying discounted postal reply coupons in other countries and redeeming them at face value in the United States as a form of arbitrage. 

In reality, Ponzi was paying earlier investors using the investments of later investors. His scheme ran for over a year before it collapsed, costing his ""investors"" $20 million.

While this type of fraudulent investment scheme was not originally invented by Ponzi, it became so identified with him that it now is referred to as a Ponzi scheme.

Pompeii was an ancient Roman city near modern Naples in the Campania region of Italy, in the territory of the comune of Pompei. Pompeii, along with Herculaneum and many villas in the surrounding area, was buried under 4 to 6 m (13 to 20 ft) of volcanic ash and pumice in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. Many of the inhabitants were also buried before they could escape.

wZz11Y2CAPo,"INSANE Chinese Seafood - $1500 Seafood FEAST in Guangzhou, China - 10 KG BIGGEST Lobster + KING Crab","INSANE Chinese Seafood FEAST in Guangzhou! Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF! We found the most CRAZY Chinese Seafood in Guangzhou. This Chinese seafood restaurant is like a huge seafood Aquarium!  There is so much EXOTIC Chinese seafood here! This is like upgraded Chinese street food! GIANT Seafood HEAVEN!

If you're wanting to eat seafood in Guangzhou, you can come to Guangzhou HongXing restaurant. It has the most INSANE selection of Chinese seafood from around the world, all picked up daily from the local fish market! They have every type of seafood you can order it in a huge variety of different cooking styles. 

When you walk into hongxing seafood restaurant, you immediately feel like you're walking into a seafood heaven. This is different from our regular Chinese street food videos, this is a  Chinese seafood feast video! And today we are featuring all cantonese style cooking, one of the 8 main specialties of Chinese cuisine! This is less spicy than Sichuan food, this is much more elegant and refined and clear style, very delicious!

When you walk in, you'll see hundreds of different fish tanks full of  seafood!

You'll see at least 2 aisles full of lobster from around the world. Australian lobster, Boston lobster, and more. And you'll also find aisles full of different crabs from around the world. The biggest ones are the Alaskan king prawns. You can order these steamed or boiled and covered in a garlic sauce.  The crab legs are full of flesh! Super tasty! This is Chinese style seafood mukbang! This is way better than a regular seafood boil!

You'll also find rows of different clams, mussels, abalone, oysters, and more exotic things too. There is water beetles, snakes,  and also classic Cantonese stir fry dishes too. You can eat dim sum, fried noodles, and cantonese desserts too!

This is one of the most expensive restaurants in Guangzhou for seafood. In my opinion, if you can afford to spend a little for one crab, it is totally worth it to taste the cantonese style of cooking. 

Chinese seafood restaurant name: ‰∏úÊ±üÈ∏øÊòüÊµ∑È≤úÈÖíÂ∫ó

dwMVKIXVTR4,Inside the Indian Generic Drug Manufacturer Cipla,"India produces over 30% of the world's entire supply of generic drugs. Cipla is one of India's largest drug manufacturers. It supplies antiretroviral drugs to about one third of AIDS patients under treatment in Africa. C&EN Senior Correspondent Jean-Fran√ßois Tremblay went inside Cipla's advanced pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing plant to learn more about the stringent regulations it must follow. India's future as the world's drugstore is a controversial topic. Other drugmakers have been heavily fined, or had products recalled or banned, because of problems at plants. And India is under pressure to make its patent system more like those in western nations. But India has found a market for low-cost drugs and that market isn't about to disappear.

The Citadel of Modlin Fortress, nowadays known as Garnizon Modlin (The Modlin Garrison) is unique on a global scale - the longest building in Europe and the second largest in the world. The spectacular fortress is located in the very heart of Poland, at the confluence of three rivers: the Vistula, the Narew and the Bug, in the immediate vicinity of picturesque sandy beaches hidden among forests and the phenomenal ruins of a historic granary. The Modlin Fortress is also over 200 years of turbulent history. The Poles, the French, Russians and Germans fought for this pearl of Napoleon and Tsar Nicholas I. After years of peace, in June 2018 Citadel will survive another siege, this time by the fans of electrifying sounds during the forthcoming INSTYTUT Festival :)

The Invisalign system is a combination of proprietary virtual modeling software, rapid manufacturing processes and mass customization, and virtually clear, removable appliances or ""aligners"" that are used to straighten teeth.

The Invisalign system is prescribed to patients through trained Invisalign orthodontists or general practitioner dentists (GP dentists). Align provides clinical education programs and the tools needed for orthodontists or GP dentists to offer Invisalign treatment options in their practices. Although treatment time varies by patient, on average a patient requires one full year of treatment - equivalent to 24 sets of Invisalign aligners.

Similar to channels such as BuzzFeed, WatchCut, TheFineBros & GMM we focus on creating content that depicts people (usually Irish people) experiencing new things for the first time, whether that be food, drink or maybe a TV show!",Food
6DP8INm09nY,Irish Potato Famine - Black &#39;47 - Extra History - #3,"Watching the Irish suffer from the view of London, Sir Charles Trevelyan believed that the potato famine was part of God's will. Inspired by the meritocracy-based philosophy of starvation that Thomas Malthus held, Treveylan created a relief plan with the sole goal of protecting the markets, and not the people. Thus the new year of ""Black '47"" brought chaos and horror to the Irish people.

gAnT21xGdSk,Irish Potato Famine - Isle of Blight - Extra History - #1,"The potato blight hit the United States first before it came to Ireland (and other countries). But what made it particularly devastating in Ireland was the factor of human influence--behind-the-scenes bureaucracy that prioritized economics over human lives.

pP0Rlw8mo8g,Is Music Art? ‚Äì Hangout on Air,"In our fifth and final 'Hangout on Air', Miranda Sawyer is joined by artist Haroon Mirza, music producer Will Skeaping, record sleeve designer Leif Podhajsky and Tate's Adrian Shaw for a lively discussion about music and art.

Miranda Sawyer is a journalist, writer and broadcaster covering a wide range of interests, including music, art, radio and theatre. She is currently a feature writer and radio critic for The Observer, and is a regular arts critic in print and on television and radio. Miranda is also on the board of Tate Members.

Haroon Mirza is a British artist who combines a variety of readymade and time based material to create audio compositions, which are often realised as site-specific installations. In doing so, Mirza complicates the distinctions between noise, sound and music, and alters the function and meaning of everyday objects and and socio-cultural constructs.

Adrian Shaw is part of Tate‚Äôs Learning department, working on the Young People‚Äôs Programme. He has been organising music events since the early 1990‚Äôs and introduced large scale music programming to Tate over 10 years ago.  Now established as ‚ÄòLate at Tate‚Äô, these events often explore the boundaries between music, performance and art.  Adrian is also a musician, and one half of the arts duo boyleANDshaw.

Will Skeaping is a creative consultant and music producer. Following a tour of duty at Google, he worked closely with rappers, authors and film makers as label manager at Lex Records, focusing on collaborations between artists and musicians. He is currently making an album uniting English folk music with vintage analogue synthesizers. 

Leif Podhajsky is an Australian artist and graphic designer, who‚Äôs distinctive bright, surreal abstractions have featured on posters and album covers for musicians including Mount Kimbie, Tame Impala, Grimes, Lykki Li and Foals. Leif says his work ‚Äúexplores themes of connectedness, the relevance of nature and the psychedelic or altered experience.‚Äù

ü•íABOUT BEFRS:
Hey, I‚Äôm Sonny! I‚Äôm from the US but currently call Vietnam home. I‚Äôve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. People either enjoyed my undeniable charm or enjoyed watching me eat things like coconut worms, and thus Best Ever Food Review Show came to be. 

I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.

Don‚Äôt forget to subscribe to Best Ever Food Review Show, so we can connect through food and travel and become Bestys!

cHcgrFDu8Qg,Japanese Hotels vs American Hotels - 14 Differences,"Staying at hotels in Japan is a very unique experience.  From the amazing utilization of space, to the wonderful service, I compare and contrast the differences between Japanese ‚ÄúWestern Style‚Äù hotels in Japan and the same types of ‚ÄúBusiness‚Äù hotels in the USA. Japan has lots of type of hotels, Capsule Hotels, Manga Cafes, Hostels, Love Hotels, Overnight Buses, Traditional Japanese Inns (Ryokans).  I‚Äôll be comparing Japanese ‚ÄúWestern Style‚Äù or ‚ÄúBusiness‚Äù hotels in big cities like Osaka, Tokyo, etc.

1 - Location: In Japan better to be closer to a train station‚Ä¶ right on top of the train station is the best.  Or connected to the train station.  Hotels advertise how many mins walk they are from the station.

2 - Room types:  Japanese hotels have a gazillion room types and packages.  Not obvious from the english website.  Different meal plans, pork, chicken, beef.  ‚ÄúHollywood Twin Room‚Äù one where the twin beds are seperate.  I almost never book the cheapest room type.

3 - People in the room:  Very strict in Japan.  Adults and children.  Also how many men and how many women? In the US it usually doesn‚Äôt matter.

4 - Arriving at the hotel: They really want to take your luggage.  And they don‚Äôt expect a tip.  Service in a Japanese hotel takes on a whole new level.

5 - Parking:  Don‚Äôt expect parking.  Maybe an ‚Äúelevator‚Äù or ‚Äúferris wheel‚Äù type garage.  Often no parking, or parking 5 blocks away.  

6 - Check-in: Very thorough in Japan.  Always fill-out a card.  Show passport.

7 - The room itself:  Japanese rooms are small.  And by small I mean really small!

Mattress -- often on the firm side.

Pillows -- filled with beans.  And usually only one.

Bathrooms: Smart toilets.  Bathroom amenities.  Handheld shower.  Stool.  Toilet slippers. Deep bath tubs.  Often ‚Äúmodular‚Äù

Pajamas -- sometimes western style, other times Yukata.

Always a Tea Kettle, and tea.

Air purifier, humidifier.

Often a pants press, and fabric freshener spray.

8 - Breakfast:  Japanese & Western Style Breakfasts.  Japanese breakfast is usually a set meal.  Western breakfast is usually a buffet.  Japanese chains usually have a more elaborate breakfast per price than western hotels.  Ice Cream!  And always a breakfast coupon.  You can always find a 7-11 near by.

9 - Room Service:  Usually not an option -- but in-room massage service is.

10 - Hotel Bar:  Only if they cater to westerners -- otherwise a beer vending machine.

11 - Gym: What‚Äôs that?  Only if they cater to westerners -- make you sign a waiver.

12 - Pool: Wear a swim cap and goggles!

13 - Check-out: Is still a process.  Often a check-out gift.  No mobile or TV check-out.



14- Onsen Hotels.
Typically in the countryside
City dwellers retreat for the weekend to get away
Kyoto has some Ryokans
Often small and family run.
Arriving -- check in is shorter
your personal room attendant shows you to your room
Makes tea with snack, explains the hotel.
minimalistic tatami mat room
No shoes (off at the room, or front of hotel)
yukata ‚Äì a Japanese-style robe ‚Äì and slippers
Japanese futon bedding
shoji screens made from strong rice paper that ‚Äúslide‚Äù instead of swing
table called a zataku instead of a Western table. (short legs, sigh ton the floor) 
Legless chairs and floor pillows surround the table. 
In colder months, it may have an embedded heater to keep your legs warm.
Maybe no shower/bath in the room.

Mz2OSnUjILQ,japanese street food - OKONOMIYAKI „ÅäÂ•Ω„ÅøÁÑº„Åç,"Okonomiyaki „ÅäÂ•Ω„ÅøÁÑº„Åç o-konomi-yaki is a Japanese savory pancake containing a variety of ingredients. The name is derived from the word okonomi, meaning ""how you like"" or ""what you like"", and yaki meaning ""grill"". Okonomiyaki is mainly associated with the Kansai or Hiroshima areas of Japan, but is widely available throughout the country. Toppings and batters tend to vary according to region. In Tokyo, there is a semi-liquid okonomiyaki called 'monjayaki.'„ÅäÂ•Ω„ÅøÁÑº„Åç
Kansai- or Osaka-style okonomiyaki is the predominant version of the dish, found throughout most of Japan. The batter is made of flour, grated nagaimo (a type of yam), water or dashi, eggs and shredded cabbage, and usually contains other ingredients such as green onion, meat (generally thin pork belly, often mistaken for bacon), octopus, squid, shrimp, vegetables, konjac, mochi or cheese. Okonomiyaki is sometimes compared to an omelette or a pancake and may be referred to as a ""Japanese pizza"" or ""Osaka soul food""„ÅäÂ•Ω„ÅøÁÑº„Åç
Some okonomiyaki restaurants are grill-it-yourself establishments, where the server produces a bowl of raw ingredients that the customer mixes and grills at tables fitted with teppan, or special hotplates. They may also have a diner-style counter where the cook prepares the dish in front of the customers.
In Osaka (the largest city in the Kansai region), where this dish is said to have originated, okonomiyaki is prepared much like a pancake. The batter and other ingredients are pan-fried on both sides on either a teppan or a pan using metal spatulas that are later used to slice the dish when it has finished cooking. Cooked okonomiyaki is topped with ingredients that include otafuku/okonomiyaki sauce (similar to Worcestershire sauce but thicker and sweeter), aonori (seaweed flakes), katsuobushi (bonito flakes), Japanese mayonnaise, and pickled ginger (beni shoga).„ÅäÂ•Ω„ÅøÁÑº„Åç",Food

zkSQ_ud6hnE,Joanna Lumley&#39;s Nile: Sudan | History Documentary | Reel Truth History,"Now two weeks into her journey down the Nile, Joanna Lumley leaves Egypt behind her, crossing Lake Nasser by ferry and entering Sudan. During the 18 hour journey she has to deal with crowding and less than sanitary conditions but agreeable travel companions. She gets to view the great statues at Abu Simbel as they pass by. They then travel by car to Wawa where they boat down a stretch of Nile in search of giant crocodiles that can grow up to 20 feet long. A further trip by car takes them to a holy mountain and then go deep underground to visit the tomb of a Queen who lived circa 650 B.C.

He recounts the differences that his mentoring by Bill Lear made in his own career and contrasts this kind of education with the more traditional approach:

""A lot of schools teach people how to make technology. What we try to do here that‚Äôs a little bit different is to teach people how to make their technology go to work, how to get it really implemented and in the world and doing something.  There are a lot of people with good ideas, but very few of them change the world.""

8HPdVnxjNxw,June Carbone: Gender and the Tournament: Reinventing Antidiscrimination Law in an Age of Inequality,"Since the 1970‚Äôs, antidiscrimination advocates have approached Title VII as though the impact of the law on minorities and women could be considered in isolation.  This article argues that this is a mistake.  Instead, Gender and the Tournament attempts to reclaim Title VII‚Äôs original approach, which justified efforts to dismantle segregated workplaces as necessary to both eliminate discrimination and promote economic growth.  Using that approach, this Article is the first to consider how widespread corporate tournaments and growing gender disparities in the upper echelons of the economy are intrinsically intertwined, and how they undermine the core promises of antidiscrimination law.  The Article draws on a pending case challenging the ‚Äúrank and yank‚Äù evaluation system at Microsoft, as well as social science literature regarding narcissism and stereotype expectations, to illustrate how consideration of the legitimacy of competitive pay for performance schemes is essential to combating the intrinsically gendered nature of advancement in the new economy.

Lyrics:
Days like this I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drain me down
That was then and this is now
Now look at me

Chorus:
This is the part of me
That you‚Äôre never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you‚Äôre never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you‚Äôre not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you‚Äôre never gonna ever take away from me, no

I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

Chorus:
This is the part of me
That you‚Äôre never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you‚Äôre never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you‚Äôre not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you‚Äôre never gonna ever take away from me, no

Bridge:
Now look at me I‚Äôm sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You won‚Äôt never put me out again
I‚Äôm glowing oh whoa
So you can keep the diamond ring
It don‚Äôt mean nothing anyway
In fact you can keep everything
Yeah yeah, except for me

Chorus:
This is the part of me
That you‚Äôre never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you‚Äôre never gonna ever take away from me, no (away from me)
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you‚Äôre not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you‚Äôre never gonna ever take away from me, no

This is the part of me (no)
(away from me) This is the part of me
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you‚Äôre not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you‚Äôre never gonna ever take away from me, no

The Khajuraho Group of Monuments is a group of Hindu and Jain temples in Madhya Pradesh, India, about 175 kilometres (109 mi) southeast of Jhansi. They are one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India.[The temples are famous for their nagara-style architectural symbolism and their erotic sculptures.

Most Khajuraho temples were built between 950 and 1050 by the Chandela dynasty. Historical records note that the Khajuraho temple site had 85 temples by the 12th century, spread over 20 square kilometers. Of these, only about 25 temples have survived, spread over 6 square kilometers.Of the various surviving temples, the Kandariya Mahadeva Temple is decorated with a profusion of sculptures with intricate details, symbolism and expressiveness of ancient Indian art

The Khajuraho group of temples were built together but were dedicated to two religions, Hinduism and Jainism, suggesting a tradition of acceptance and respect for diverse religious views among Hindus and Jains in the region

Korean Seafood - https://youtu.be/pObPqffympM

Our final video in Seoul, South Korea features the classics of KOREAN STREET FOOD, starting at the Gwangjang Market (Kwangjang Market). We sample some of our favourite Korean dishes including tteokbokki, kimchi mandu and japchae. We also stopped on the way out for dessert, eating a bean porridge which was delicious! We explore the famous Ikseon-dong Hanok village for souvenirs and stop at a busy coffee shop for sweets and caffeine. Later that day, we eat something that you CAN‚ÄôT MISS while in Korea - KOREAN BBQ! This Korean barbecue cooks the pork belly and the kimchi together - and the mix is delicious. We washed the meal down with soju. It was an AWESOME day of eating Korean food. For information on how to visit yourself, see below:

mMuy58DaqOk,"Krauss, Meyer, Lamoureux: What‚Äôs Behind it all? God, Science and the Universe.","Has a scientific explanation of the universe replaced the need for God as cause of its origins? Could life on our planet exist apart from divine intervention? Is there evidence for a designer? Does it even matter?

Join us live at Convocation Hall at the University of Toronto, or stream to your site via YouTube, as we explore explanations of life and our universe. We are bringing together three top minds from three different perspectives for this 2-hour dialogue. We invite you to be a part of the conversation on March 19, 2016 - ""What Is Behind It All? God, Science and the Universe.""


ABOUT THE SPEAKERS:

PROF. DR. LAWRENCE M. KRAUSS, is an internationally known theoretical physicist with wide research interests, including the interface between elementary particle physics and cosmology, where his studies include the early universe, the nature of dark matter, general relativity and neutrino astrophysics. He has investigated questions ranging from the nature of exploding stars to issues of the origin of all mass in the universe. He was born in New York City and moved shortly thereafter to Toronto, Canada, where he grew up. He received undergraduate degrees in both Mathematics and Physics at Carleton University. He received his Ph.D. in Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1982), then joined the Harvard Society of Fellows (1982-85). 

DR. STEPHEN C. MEYER,  Intelligent Design advocate, received his Ph.D. in the philosophy of science from the University of Cambridge. A former geophysicist and college professor, he now directs Discovery Institute‚Äôs Center for Science and Culture in Seattle. He has authored the New York Times best seller Darwin‚Äôs Doubt: The Explosive Origin of Animal Life and the Case for Intelligent Design (HarperOne, 2013) as well as Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design (HarperOne, 2009), which was named a Book of the Year by the Times (of London) Literary Supplement in 2009. In his first book on intelligent design, Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design (HarperOne, 2009) Meyer examined the mystery of the origin of the first life. With Darwin‚Äôs Doubt, he has expanded the scope of the case for intelligent design to the whole sweep of life‚Äôs history. 

DR. DENIS O. LAMOUREUX, received three earned doctorates: a Ph.D. in Oral Biology-Dental Development and Evolution (University of Alberta), a Doctor of Dental Surgery, DDS, (University of Alberta), and a Ph.D. in Interdisciplinary Theology-Science and Religion (University of St. Michael's College at the University of Toronto). An award winning teacher, Dr. Lamoureux is an Associate Professor of Science and Religion at St. Joseph's College in the University of Alberta. His appointment is the first tenure-track position in Canada dedicated to teaching and research on the relationship between scientific discovery and Christian faith. Lamoureux's academic specialty focuses on the modern origins controversy. Previous to this he was a clinical instructor in the Faculty of Dentistry at the University of Alberta from 1991 to 1996, had a private dental practice, and served as a Canadian Armed Forces Dental Officer (he received United Nations & Canadian Peace Keeping Medals in 1980 and 2003). 

ABOUT THE SERIES:

The Religion and Society Series is a movement to generate conversations on the ultimate questions of life. The purpose of the Series is to play a catalytic role in helping community groups and churches across Canada to engage people in topics that deeply matter to individuals and society.

A 5 axis laser metal deposition manufacturing method is being developed by TWI for an EU-funded project which is demonstrating  drastic time reduction in the manufacture of aero engine casings.

In LMD, a weld track is formed using metal powder as a filler material which is fed, through a coaxial nozzle, to a melt pool created by a focused high-power laser beam. By traversing both the nozzle and laser, a new material layer develops with precise accuracy and user-defined properties. The application of multi-layering techniques allows 3D structures to be created.",Manufacturing

We met travelling around India, and quickly agreed that rather than ‚Äúsettling down‚Äù and doing what most normal people do, we wanted to travel and adventure instead and started our sailing lifestyle adventure stories, since then, we‚Äôve been working hard towards achieving our dreams, and now we‚Äôre finally living them as sailing cruising lifestyle!

B8Pkp7OhwPg,"Lean Manufacturing: Cycle Time Analysis, Variance Tracking &amp; Eliminating Work Stoppages","http://www.driveyoursuccess.com 

The following video is a summary of a project that was run for a small manufacturer were we analyzed their production throughput, performed cycle time analysis and review while also tracking the variances in those cycle times. We use three methods to calculate average in cycle time analysis for this and other projects. These three are the mean, the mode and the median.

The video explains how to calculate manufacturing cycle time averages in these three aforementioned ways. The mean is the one we always associate as average. This simply involves taking all the cycle times in a given sample portion and dividing it by the number of operations or cycle times captured.

The next method of the mode manufacturing cycle time which is simply the cycle time that appears most frequently during the sample portion. Ultimately, the mode is often the one where the work stoppages and downtime are not a factor. As such, it's often the best benchmark for cycle time analysis.

Finally, the median involves re-configuring all the times from lowest to highest and using the following calculation to identify the average time: Median { ( N + 1 ) / 2 } where N is the number of operations. In this case, it's 10 +1 = 11 divided by 2 which is 5.5. Therefore, we isolate the cycle time in-between the 5th and 6th time. 

Finally, all of these cycle times are placed on a graph in order to identify the variances in cycle times and high and low points. The idea is to isolate the root causes of high and low cycle times while putting a plan in motion to eliminate causes of work stoppages.

President Leon Botstein of Bard College steps boldly into the fray to answer one of the most enduring human questions: What is art? This discussion spills over into debates about art's value to society ---- whether access to the arts is right as basic as education or health care, and whether it should be assessed and supported by government or left to the ""invisible hand"" of the free market. President Botstein explains why it is essential to ask these questions and offers a sturdy basis for evaluating them. He goes so far as to suggest that engaging with art can give our lives meaning and purpose. Ôªø

Today, I‚Äôm (Trevor James, The Food Ranger) bringing you with us as we venture into the DEEP street foods of Old Dhaka to taste some of the best restaurants in Dhaka. Bangladeshi Street Food HEAVEN!!! Make sure to watch all the way until the end of this street food video because there is a lot of delicious cuisine you are going to love!! I‚Äôm a food lover and food vlogger who has been traveling full time around the world to bring you the best street food around the world! In today‚Äôs food and travel video, we‚Äôre in Old Dhaka trying some AMAZING Bangladeshi street food that is MIND BLOWING and tasty!!!

When we first flew in to Dhaka, Bangladesh, we had no idea how AMAZING Bengali cuisine is. After trying the street food in Old Dhaka, I‚Äôm convinced that it‚Äôs some of the best street food around the world, and that Street food in Bangladesh is worth spending a lifetime exploring! 

First up, we‚Äôre going to the Dhaka University area to try a famous street food in Dhaka, the Kola Bhorta, an ULTRA complex and delicious street food made in a mortar and pestle. It had hog plum, mustard, olive, tamarind, sugar, chili, coriander, and chili, and was made by the most friendly vendor! It was spicy, sour, bitter, sweet, pungent, and very intense!

Next, we‚Äôre bringing you to the New Market area of Dhaka, right outside Old Dhaka, an area bustling with food stalls and super fast paced bustle. The street food vendors here work with ULTRA FAST speed and you can tell that everyone is in a hurry because there is so much food and street stalls packed in here. I ordered a Bhel Puri, a kind of crispy puff filled with chickpea and lentil mash and chili with tamarind chutney and topped with a cold cucumber, tomato, and onion salad. It was an amazing street food to try! 

Next up, we‚Äôre bringing you to a FAMOUS Restaurant in Dhaka, the MAMA Haleem! Here, an ULTRA THICK beef stew is prepared with lentils, wheat, mustard, and Bengali spices in a HUGE POT! It tastes so delicious and spicy and is one of the most filling street foods you‚Äôll ever eat in the whole world! 

After that amazing street food in Bangladesh, we‚Äôre bringing you to eat a famous breakfast in Bangladesh at star hotel. Here, one of the most delicious mutton food stews AKA pays is served bright an early every day at 6am. We got up early and were surprised to see the place was PACKED with locals slurping away at this delicious Bengali food! We also ordered a beef heart curry, dal, local tea, and naan. It was an incredibly filling and flavour packed breakfast!

And before visiting the BRAIN FRY KING of Bangladesh, we‚Äôre going for a FAMOUS biryani dish in Old Dhaka, the Kachi biryani. It was prepared in these huge pots with big goat leg pieces and was one of the most aromatic biryani‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever tried! It had a caraway flavour and was a little mustardy as well! Mustard is such an important part of Bengali cuisine, and we fell in love with the food during our trip mainly because of this mustard flavour in everything, it‚Äôs so delicious and fluffy!!

After the AMAZING Biryani, we‚Äôre bringing you to our final stop, the BRAIN FRY KING of Bangladesh! Here, you can taste amazing Brain fry and beef chap marinated in a ton of spices and put into a deep and dark oil that is intensely flavourful. When it comes out, you grab a luchi and wrap it up and pop it in your mouth, and it‚Äôs quite delicious! Watching the BRAIN FRY KING of Bangladesh work with superhuman speed as he fries up the brain and the beef chap was very fun!

T4huyml1Adg,"Live Q&amp;A (&amp;B) session. Travel tips for budget travel, backpacking, saving money and couple travel!","This was our first livestream of the year.
We love the interaction with people and love to answer your questions! We hope watching this video motivates you a little more to travel and to explore the world!
We always like to answer your questions and help you with travel or non travel questions!
On this one, we had some food and some beers while chatting. 
We think we are going to do this more often! 

In this one we talked about budget travel, how to stay, sleep, eat cheap or even for free: couchsurfing, workaway, housesitting...
Maybe we should do one QnA focused on that too! Do you like the idea? Leave a comment!

We also talk about how to enjoy travel, about culture shock, travel slow, enjoy food and many other things that we know a bit!

We are a Spanishüá™üá∏-Koreanüá∞üá∑ married couple ü§µüèªüë∞üèª who quit jobs to travel around the worldüåè , meeting peopleü§ù learning cultures üó∫, trying foods üçΩ and enjoying this beautiful planet üå±!

AFFILIATE LINK DISCLOSURE: Friends, making a quality Loloho video is kind of like making sausage ‚Äì only slightly more violent. It's a ridiculous amount of work that typically involves high dollar camera drops, blue-screen-of-death computer crashes, and at least one angry shotgun wielding old man shouting, ‚ÄúHey! Get the hell outta here!‚Äù Once the final video is posted, rewards here on YouTube are few and far between (unless you are a masochist who enjoys being verbally abused by anonymous trolls). One saving grace is our affiliate links. JUST CLICKING THESE LINKS HELPS TO SUPPORT OUR LITTLE SHOW. Think of this clicking as like tipping - except that it doesn't cost you anything extra! If you eventually make a purchase via one of our affiliate links, we will receive a few pennies (and Sean typically invests these pennies in duct tape and video gear). Again, it doesn't cost you anything to click these links, and it's a great help to us. As always, safe travels, happy camping, and THANK YOU!",Travel

Watch my face and listen to my words in this YouTube live stream as I discuss how I live, love, and laugh in Thailand. Living and working in Thailand is such a privileged. Through my Thailand travel vlogs, I try to explain why traveling Thailand, even with a full time teaching job, creates a freedom in your life that you will rarely experience. Many questions from the comments in this video were related to places like Hua Hin, bangkok, Chiang Mai, Ko samui, and other islands in Thailand, which I have not been to yet. 
The good news is, the more I communicate with the subscribers of this YouTube channel, the more I enjoy life in Thailand, and the potential for exploration of more of this country, other than weekends in Pattaya, Thailand.
Thailand travel has really taught me to love, laugh, and appreciate the little things in my life. I would like to thank you all for the superchats, which enable me to bring you more content each month. I love you guys, and can't wait to show you more of Thailand, and Southeast Asia!

The Polish Deli London offers a wide range of delicious and authentic Polish food. Sample traditionally madepork smoked sausages served with salad and pickles in a baguette, or with roasted baby potatoes, cured meats, Polish draught beer and, in winter, sauerkraut stew, made with smoked pork sausage.  When Will and Kerry hand you your gourmet burger, you‚Äôre getting it from the hands of the same people who raised the cows and grew the wheat and grass they feasted on. The beef is hung on the bone for three weeks, then they seam cut the beef (a continental style of butchery which cuts around the muscles rather than slicing straight through them). They bind the burgers with their own free range eggs. 

And if that is not enough for you, pop a couple of their steaks in your bag to take home.",Food

1o8oIELbNxE,Luther and the Protestant Reformation: Crash Course World History #218,"In which John Green teaches you about the Protestant Reformation. Prior to the Protestant Reformation, pretty much everyone in Europe was a Roman Catholic. Not to get all great man, but Martin Luther changed all that. Martin Luther didn't like the corruption he saw in the  church, especially the sale of indulgences, so he left the church and started his own. And it caught on! And it really did kind of change the world. The changes increased literacy and education, and some even say the Protestant Reformation was the beginning of Capitalism in Europe.

¬ª THE TRADITIONAL FOOD IN MADAGASCAR

1. TSENA‚ÄôNY TANTSAHA TALATAMATY: Rice Porridge + Chinese Noodle Soup
ADDRESS: Talatamaty City  
OPEN: 3AM - 7AM (or whenever the police shut it down) 

Four miles outside of Madagascar‚Äôs capital city, Antananarivo, lies Talatamaty City. Talatamaty City is home to one of the country‚Äôs largest local morning markets, Tsena‚Äôny Tantsaha. Sellers open up shop at 3am, selling everything from produce to fabrics. And lucky for us, the market has no shortage of food to try as well. 

ü•£RICE PORRIDGE: Zebu (Malagasy cattle) and sausage are mixed with leaves, ginger, special Malagasy rice, porridge and spices. 

ü•°CHINESE NOODLE DISH: Pasta, macaroni, potato, mayonnaise and zebu skin. 
----
2. TALATA VOLON‚ÄôONDRY: Sausage + Koba
ADDRESS: Talata Volon‚Äôondry 
OPEN: Varies 

Talata Volon‚Äôondry is a village located just outside of Antananarivo. The village is known for producing sausage and Madagascar‚Äôs national snack, koba. 

ü•îSAUSAGE: There are typically two types of sausage being sold - zebu sausage and a halal style potato sausage. This snack is frequently accompanied by local rum. 

üá≤üá¨KOBA: Lay out banana leaf spines with banana leaves on top. Add a layer of rice flour to prevent the koba mixture from sticking to the banana leaves. Then add the koba mixture, a combination of crushed raw peanuts and sugar. Wrap it all up in the banana leaves and allow it to cook in a bit of water for 3 days. 

Koba is beloved across Madagascar, primarily sold on the street or to people in their cars as they drive through a city. The fuel from the ingredients gives people energy and helps them stay full even when walking long distances without and source of food along the way.
üí∏PRICE: Sausage .14 USD/500 MGA | Koba .50 USD/1,756 MGA

Hey, I‚Äôm Sonny! I‚Äôm from the US but currently call Vietnam home. I‚Äôve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. People either enjoyed my undeniable charm or enjoyed watching me eat things like coconut worms, and thus Best Ever Food Review Show came to be.

I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.

MELAKA, MALAYSIA - Malaysian Food Tour!

Melaka (also sometimes spelled Malacca) is a beautiful city in southern Malaysia, significant in history, packed with delicious food, and again, like most of Malaysia, a melting pot of cultures, peoples and foods.

Here‚Äôs what we ate in this food tour of Melaka, Malaysia:

Kedai Kopi Chung Wah - One of the foods you have to eat in Melaka is Hainanese chicken rice balls. The rice is cooked with chicken broth like most chicken rice, but instead of just a plate of rice, you get little fish ball shaped rice balls, along with chicken. It‚Äôs an iconic dish, but it‚Äôs pretty delicious and makes a wonderful breakfast.
Total price - 29 MYR ($7.12)

Asam Pedas Pak Man - Asam pedas is sour spicy, and you‚Äôll find variations of it across much of Southeast Asia, but Melaka is quite famous for it within Malaysia. We went to Asam Pedas Pak Man, a stall set up within a local Malaysian food court. I ordered a variety of different plates, each asam pedas but with a different fish. All were spectacular. It looks extremely spicy, but it‚Äôs not actually all that spicy, however it is extremely tasty and full of herbs and chilies and flavor. Best Malaysian food dish of the day in Melaka for me.
Total price - 75 MYR ($18.39)

Klebang Original Coconut Shake - This was pretty ordinary for me, nothing spectacular, but again it‚Äôs one of those things most people try in Melaka.
Total price - 9.90 MYR ($2.43)

Ban Lee Siang Satay Celup - Next up, satay celup, a unique Melaka style satay where you choose your own skewers and boil them in the sauce right in the middle of your table. For me honestly, satay celup is too sweet, but I have to admit it‚Äôs a lot of fun to eat and cook, and very social.
Total price - 34 MYR ($8.34)

Ikan Bakar Haji Masu - Finally to end this Malaysian food tour in Melaka (Malacca), we went to a seafood, ikan bakar (grilled fish) restaurant. There are quite a few huge seafood restaurants in Melaka, but I wanted one that was kind of small and laid back. Ikan Bakar Haji Masu was fantastic, and I think the best thing was their grilled fish.
Total price - 99 MYR ($24.27)

Thank you for watching this Malaysian food tour in Melaka. It‚Äôs an amazing city to visit when you are in Malaysia.

URL: http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/USL/01065
Description: The Portuguese cowbell is a traditional idiophone percussion instrument that provides an unmistakable soundscape in rural areas. Alc√°√ßovas is the main manufacturing centre where the cowbells, traditionally used by shepherds to manage livestock, are made. The practice is transmitted from father to son and requires a series of processes before the handmade iron pieces are polished and fine-tuned. Yet the tradition is becoming unsustainable as new grazing methods, cheaper industrial techniques and fewer cowbell makers are leading to its demise.

Manufacture of Steel by Bessemer Process

Molten pig iron from the blast furnace is stored in a mixer to keep the pig iron molten and at an identical temperature and also keep the composition of the molten metal from dissimilar lots quite uniform.

     Bessemer is tilted on its side to receive molten iron from the mixer. Then Bessemer is brought back to vertical location and air is blown in at a pressure of 20 lbs. per square inch. The air will combine with molten metal. Dark red flames mixed with brown flames will come out of the mouth of the convertor in the beginning showing the burning of silicon and manganese. With these flames particles of molten iron and molten slag also come out.

kusAX4Th4N8,Manufacturing Consent: Thought Control in a Democratic Society - Noam Chomsky,"Walter Lippmann (23 September 1889 -- 14 December 1974) was an American public intellectual, writer, reporter, and political commentator famous for being among the first to introduce the concept of Cold War. More Chomsky: https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&tag=tra0c7-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=685da0c9f3d6ee8085f8c084206f56c8&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=books&keywords=chomsky

Lippmann was twice awarded (1958 and 1962) a Pulitzer Prize for his syndicated newspaper column, ""Today and Tomorrow"".

Edward Louis Bernays (November 22, 1891 -- March 9, 1995), was an Austrian-American pioneer in the field of public relations and propaganda, referred to in his obituary as ""the father of public relations."" He combined the ideas of Gustave Le Bon and Wilfred Trotter on crowd psychology with the psychoanalytical ideas of his uncle, Sigmund Freud.

He felt this manipulation was necessary in society, which he regarded as irrational and dangerous as a result of the 'herd instinct' that Trotter had described. Adam Curtis's award-winning 2002 documentary for the BBC, The Century of the Self, pinpoints Bernays as the originator of modern public relations, and Bernays was named one of the 100 most influential Americans of the 20th century by Life magazine.

Harold Dwight Lasswell (February 13, 1902 ‚Äî December 18, 1978) was a leading American political scientist and communications theorist. He was a member of the Chicago school of sociology and was a professor at Yale University in law. He was a President of the American Political Science Association (APSA) and World Academy of Art and Science (WAAS). According to a biographical memorial written by Gabriel Almond at the time of Lasswell's death and published by the National Academies of Sciences in 1987, Lasswell ""ranked among the half dozen creative innovators in the social sciences in the twentieth century."" At the time, Almond asserted that ""few would question that he was the most original and productive political scientist of his time."" Areas of research in which Lasswell worked included the importance of personality, social structure, and culture in the explanation of political phenomena. He was noted to be ahead of his time in employing a variety of methodological approaches that later became standards across a variety of intellectual traditions including interviewing techniques, content analysis, para-experimental techniques, and statistical measurement.

The Committee on Public Information, also known as the CPI or the Creel Committee, was an independent agency of the government of the United States created to influence U.S. public opinion regarding American participation in World War I. Over just 28 months, from April 13, 1917, to August 21, 1919, it used every medium available to create enthusiasm for the war effort and enlist public support against foreign attempts to undercut America's war aims.

y0GbNwKmHaE,MANUFACTURING GUILT - A Short Film About Mumia Abu-Jamal&#39;s Case,"""Wow, masterful work! This piece broaches new ground in a number of areas...¬†It is easily absorbed by the uninitiated and illuminating.""-- Linn Washington, Journalist, Philadelphia Tribune

MANUFACTURING GUILT is a short film that appears as a Bonus Feature on our dvd¬†MUMIA: LONG DISTANCE REVOLUTIONARY (www.firstrunfeatures.com/mumiadvd.html).  The short takes on the colossus of Abu-Jamal's contentious case, distilling a mountain of evidence and years of oft-repeated falsehoods to the most fundamental elements of police and prosecutorial misconduct that illustrate a clear and conscious effort to frame Mumia Abu-Jamal for the murder of patrolman Daniel Faulkner. 

Based on the actual record of investigations and court filings from 1995 to 2003 - evidence denied by the courts and ignored in the press -¬†MANUFACTURING GUILT¬†cuts through the years of absurdities and overt racism to produce a clear picture of how Abu-Jamal's guilt was manufactured and his innocence suppressed beginning only moments after he and Faulkner were found shot in the early morning hours of December 9th, 1981. This historic and courageous film is the perfect companion to¬†Long Distance Revolutionary¬†- a film that is unequivocal in its force regarding Abu-Jamal's innocence.

""A chilling and vital inside view.""‚Ä®--Jamal Hart (Mumia's eldest son)

""Excellent and concise piece of film journalism""--Trust Movies

""Terrific! Focuses on the actual crime, with lots of specific information, going point by point over everything that is known, including a journalist's photos of the crime scene (those are amazing, by the way)... all of the questions I had (about the case) are answered in the short. So be sure to watch.""--Pop Culture Beast

Modern technologies are being implemented in both production and research processes.

The answer on demands for new technologies in material engineering  is launching of the most modern European centre of composite structures manufacturing by autoclaved technology along with a research laboratory began its operation - the Silesian Science and Technology Centre of Aviation Industry Ltd.
It focused on providing services to the aviation industry, resulting in the need for very high standards in all areas. Our idea is also to introduce the technology used so far in aviation in other areas, such as the yacht, automotive, railway and wind power industry. These new technologies can be used wherever it is necessary to use light and durable materials that guarantee high security to the end user.

eF5LVBW1vl8,Manufacturing plywood boards: then and now,"Plywood is a simple material made by glueing together thin sheets of wood, known as veneers or plies. These basic elements have remained broadly the same throughout its history. The most significant breakthrough in its production came in the early 1800s with the development of steam-powered machines that could cut veneers cheaply. The most influential of these was the rotary veneer cutter.

The cutter rotates a log against a wide, horizontal blade, causing it to ‚Äòpeel‚Äô into a continuous sheet of wood. This enables the creation of longer, wider sheets of veneer than previously possible and with little waste. Using these machines meant that plywood could be manufactured quickly and inexpensively on a large scale.

This film shows the stages in manufacturing plywood boards in the mid-20th century and today. The process remains essentially unchanged, although today many of the machines are much faster and computer controlled.

04uKmaKa8DU,Manufacturing Predictions - The future of the manufacturing industry (ISCF - Clean Growth),"What will the future of manufacturing be like?

Imagine needing a new part for a household appliance. You could order it, get it made locally and get it delivered to your door within a couple of hours.

Advances in 3D Printing and additive manufacturing will reduce waste even more, making it possible to create products and components that we can't make now.

Everything will be connected by the Internet of Things to ensure that supply can keep track of changes in demand.

Robots will take care of the repetitive, dangerous processes so that people can focus on matters where human interaction is so valuable. 

So whether you are a manufacturer or a consumer, we are going to see much more manufacturing as part of our everyday lives.

Anything, anywhere

In the next 30 years, we will see manufacturing become more and more unbound from the idea of factories as we know them today. It will be freed up to appear in new locations, becoming an empowering force that drives customisation and personalisation of products across multiple sectors. All of this thanks to 3D printing innovation.

Fast forward to 2035: Do you see a piece of jewellery you like in a shop window, but it‚Äôs not quite the right colour or size? The shop will be able to 3D print you a custom piece in minutes, based precisely on your measurements and preferences. 3D Printing will drive a true paradigm shift for manufacturing, away from the mass production in a distant factory to something that happens right in front of you, creating a bespoke product for the same cost. By 2050 you may even be able to print clothes at home from designs shared online.

To know the information of clay brick
A brick is building material used to make walls, pavements and other elements in masonry construction. Traditionally, the term brick referred to unit composed of clay, but it is now used to denote any rectangular units laid in mortar. A brick can be composed of clay-bearing soil, sand and lime, or concrete materials. Bricks are produced in numerous classes, types, materials, and sizes which vary with region and time period, and are produced in bulk quantities. Two basic categories of bricks are fired and non-fired bricks.

Pushing is a manufacturing method that emphasizes storing a lot of products in order to have them ready to push to customers at a moment's notice. This results in high carrying costs and potentially more unusable inventory as it passes its expiration date.

Pulling is more efficient than pushing. It emphasizes JIT (Just In Time) shipping and only ordering parts and products when customer orders come in. This cuts down on carrying costs and leads to a more streamlined operation. It is slower than the push method, so there is a trade-off.

Fishbowl's Whiteboard Wednesday videos break down important inventory management topics in a couple of minutes. Fishbowl is the producers of the No. 1 manufacturing and warehouse management software for QuickBooks users.",Manufacturing

Justin Davis is a multi-talented performing artist who specializes in music, dance, and poetry. In 2011 Davis became cofounder and president of SPOKEN, a Rhode Island College student club for spoken-word poets and other artists. He also performs original songs and covers before live audiences throughout the State of Rhode Island and teaches dance throughout Rhode Island and Massachusetts. A youth development major with minors in dance and jazz studies, Davis hopes to integrate literacy with the arts. He envisions a program where theater students learn to write scripts, spoken-word poets learn to write poetry, musicians learn to write lyrics and choreographers learn to write about their concepts.

CQ4gxP2NGiQ,"Mathematics, Music, and Visual Art","Bridges 4: Mathematics, Music, and Visual Art

Our talks will explore some of the many connections between mathematics, music, and visual arts, using as a springboard our collaborative work-in-progress with the Kitchener-Waterloo symphony, to be premiered in April 2016. Dmitri will begin by describing the deep similarities between the languages of music and geometry, showing how elementary musical terms like ‚Äúchord‚Äù and ‚Äúvoice leading‚Äù correspond to geometrical concepts like ‚Äúvectors in an orbifold.‚Äù This correspondence in turn allows us to appreciate the hidden logic of particular pieces, the development of styles, and entire genres. Nathan will continue by showing how mathematical ideas can underwrite visually and conceptually striking visual art. The speakers will then join forces to describe some of the challenges and opportunities of using these ideas in creating a multimedia performance.

Nathan Selikoff plays with interactivity and motion in time and space. Inspired by the behavior of systems, science, nature, and music, he combines computer code, traditional materials, and future technology to bring new ideas to life. His award-winning artwork has been exhibited and performed in galleries and venues throughout the United States and around the world. Selikoff is represented by Snap! Space in Florida, Bangkok, and Amsterdam.

Dmitri Tymoczko‚Äôs book A Geometry of Music is available from Oxford University Press, and his CDs Beat Therapy and Crackpot Hymnal are available from Bridge Records.  The author of the first music-theory article ever published by Science magazine, he has received awards from the Guggenheim foundation, the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, and other organizations.",Art and Music

lo53lV_-8_8,Maui or Kauai ‚Äì Which Hawaiian Island is Best?,"I‚Äôm fresh back from Kauai and I wanted to answer a question I get quite a bit, ‚ÄúWhich Hawaiian Island is Better, Maui or Kauai?‚Äù Maui is an destination with wide appeal and easily accessible attractions.  Maui is a cross between Oahu and Kauai.  Kauai is rural, rugged, and less touristy.  EXPAND DESCRIPTION FOR MORE.

Maui:  Wide Appeal and Accessible.  A cross between Oahu and Kauai.  The quintessential ‚Äúhoney-mooners‚Äù Island.  fancy restaurants, beachfront accommodations and lovely scenery.
Cons: too touristy, too traffic congested, but more flights because it is more touristy, which means they might be cheaper.

Kauai: Rural and Rugged.  Lush, beautiful and fairly vacant.  Nature is more exotic.  Wander in to the jungle and find a place to swim. adventure and quiet.  Local and Laid Back. Much of its treasures require an arduous hunt, hike, kayak, camp. Overall less touristy.  
Cons: The beaches aren‚Äôt good for swimming, or are hard to get to.  Nothing to do at night.  Less direct flights.

But really you can‚Äôt go wrong with either Island.. It‚Äôs Hawaii after all!

I‚Äôll be comparing in 10 different areas.

1 - Beaches:
Maui: The beaches in Wailea have been voted some of the best in the US.  Sandy bottom, easy access, and great snorkeling (Black Rock on Kaanapali ) due to calmer water.  Big Beach is beautiful.  Beach in Kaanapali is rocky.  Swimming overall better in Maui.
Kauai: Very few sandy beaches‚Ä¶ long hikes to the really good ones.  Choppy, rocky, windy, waves.

2- Food: 
Maui: Better -- more varied.  Kihei and Lahaina.  Mamas fish house is super cool.  true corporate Americana like Bubba Gump Shrimp Co and Ruth‚Äôs Chris Prime Steakhouse just in case you get home sick
Kauai: Really local -- and expensive.  Lots of ‚Äútake-out.‚Äù  Great if you like to picnic.  You better eat lunch by 2pm and dinner by 8pm though.  Few options past 9pm.  You really need to ‚Äúplan‚Äù your meals cause there aren‚Äôt alot of options.

3- Nightlife:
Maui: Mostly in Lahaina, and at the resorts in Wailea and Kaanapali.
Kauai: None.  Well -- maybe the movie theater (4 screens) at Kukui Grove or the Luau at the Hyatt.

4- Hotels:  
In Maui there are two main areas, Wailea, and Kaanapali.  Kaanapali has big high-rise hotels.  Wailea has more high end resorts.  Andaz all the way!
In Kauai no building can be taller than a palm tree -- best is the St. Regis and the Hyatt.  Condos are popular options.

5- Driving:
Maui: Can drive around the whole island.  Road to Hana is famous.  Road hugs the coast.  one of the most beautiful, scenic drives in the world with waterfalls and beaches at every hairpin turn.  Get out and explore on the Road to Hana.  Black, Red sand beaches.  Maui is overall more accessible.
Kauai: Can‚Äôt drive around‚Ä¶ road mostly inland

6- Shopping:
Maui: All big box stores (Target, Walmart, Costco, Whole Foods) by the airport.  Outlet Mall in Lahaina, shopping street in Lahaina.  High end shopping in Wailea and Kaanapali Beach.

Hey Guys!

Last weekend I filmed my summer morning routine while I was in my hometown of Amsterdam! I've been wanting to share my morning's with you guys, but I've been traveling so much I haven't been able to give you guys a REAL inside look into what I do when I am not on the road. For this routine I made one of my favorite breakfast recipes and also did my typical morning skin care routine.

I spent a little time surfing the internet for nice summer destinations, but I want to go somewhere new! Last time I went on a vacation it was in the Philippines and I loved it (Yes I WILL BE COMING BACK SOON!). Let me know your favorite vacation spots, a place where I should go to recharge and eat new FOODS!

As always I hope you guys like the video! Give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe for upcoming videos! Should I do another Q&A?

ncli94xodm8,Module 3: Make It: Manufacturing and Operations - ASU&#39;s W. P. Carey School,"Module 3  Make It: Manufacturing and Operations
Part 3 of 12  Manufacturing is a key supply chain function, but one that many students find a bit intimidating.  This episode tries to demystify manufacturing by looking at manufacturing plants that are probably just down the street.  What is the tie between research and development, product design, manufacturing, and procurement?  What about outsourcing manufacturing?  What do modern operations and manufacturing managers need to consider?

This is the 3rd installment in Arizona State University's twelve-part introduction to supply chain management video series developed by Eddie Davila, Jeff Hough, Randy Cates, Dawn Feldman, Dan Ichikawa, Ian Schmoel, and Matt Hardy.  ASU, the W. P. Carey School of Business, and the Supply Chain Management Department are proud and happy to share this video series with supply chain management departments, supply chain instructors, career specialists in high schools and universities, as well as industry leaders in an effort to inspire a new generation of supply chain management professionals across the country and around the world.

k7ngnWJ6Hks,Music is a visual art | Hunter Ewen | TEDxBoulder,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. We can use visuals to better describe music. 

Hunter Ewen is a dramatic music composer, educator, and multimedia designer. During the day, Dr. Ewen teaches strategies for digital creativity at the University of Colorado, the children‚Äôs collaborative art center Reel Kids, the City of Longmont, and as an independent educator. At night, he composes, solders, choreographs, and directs interdisciplinary projects around the world. Experimental performance practices and unusual notation figure prominently in Ewen‚Äôs works. A believer that compositions should be both seen and heard, his music looks as strange as it sounds. Swirles, squiggles, arrows, and fangs often replace traditional notes and rests. His aesthetic preferences gravitate towards yowls and yips and wails and squeals. Towards screams that masquerade as art. Towards clamor and deviance. Ewen‚Äôs music swings from chandeliers.

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",Art and Music

ETkZpJcZhkI,Muslim Chinese Street Food Tour in Islamic China | BEST Halal Food and Islam Food in China,"FOOD RANGER MERCH NOW AVAILABLE! http://bit.ly/FOODRANGER
Follow me on Insta: http://bit.ly/TheFoodRanger

Chinese Street Food Islam - Muslim Chinese Street Food - Street Food China
I made my way to Lanzhou, in search of the best Chinese street food and halal Chinese muslim food. I found a ton of street food and specialty halal snacks. Lanzhou is in the northwest of China, close to the far west Xinjiang province, and is home of the Hui people, and the food is fantastic! There was a lot of Chinese street food and Islam muslim Chinese cuisine. Just like you, I love street food around the world, and I travel for food. I came here to eat!

Street food in China is something I'm always looking to find more of! So I flew to Lanzhou, China and have been trying Chinese Muslim Hui Halal Street food non stop. Best Street Food in China I've tasted! The Chinese food is so good in Lanzhou! I've eaten street food in Bejing, street food in Shanghai, street food in Chengdu, and street food in Hong Kong, all of which has been amazing, but I have to say that the chinese street food in Lanzhou has been some of the best! 

When you think of China, you probably don't think of Islam and Halal food, but that's exactly what you'll find in the Northwest. I made my way for a  food trip to the dusty and bustling classic Silk Road city of Lanzhou specifically to try the unique halal food of the Hui people. This is the side of China not many people see, and I came here to have an authentic travel experience through food.  I found a lot of food reminiscent of countries further west, with insane amounts of lamb and beef leaving me absolutely speechless. 

Here are the addresses for the places I ate Chinese Hui Muslim Halal Street Food of in Lanzhou, China. You can show a taxi driver these addresses and he will bring you there:

dwm3PsViePo,My new art and music rehearsal studio,"Last week I signed a lease on a new space in Norristown, PA, to host my art studio as well as a rehearsal space for my band Green Cathedral. I've badly needed a dedicated space for both for a while now when the opportunity for this beautiful space came up.
I've still got some tweaking to do, and possibly adding some vertical storage racks for my artwork but I""m pretty excited to see what exciting things we can do in this space. I may have some private studio tours for my art clients and friends, and Green Cathedral will try and record some video and other fun things. Stay tuned!

Artist's Statement

Just as the planets turn in rhythm, art is the expression of life. Art is powerful and fills our lives with beauty and expression. Art is my calling! I focus on the power of color and form relationships in my work. I like my images to feel spiritual, bold and alive, and I do this through the expression of feeling colors that create exciting and vibrant statements. I love to create deep emotion, feeling and atmosphere in all my paintings. Thank you for your interest in my work!


Biography

His work is mostly representative of abstract, impressionistic form in terms of color, rendering and composition.

8wcFi5qEIPY,New Art/New Music at &#39;Intersections&#39;,"This fall, the New Art/New Music partnership between the Shepherd School of Music and Rice Gallery presents a program of music to complement the powerful installation ‚ÄúIntersections‚Äù by Pakistani-American artist Anila Agha. Her work, an intricately laser-cut box of wood suspended from the ceiling of the Rice Gallery, permeates the space with its cast shadows from a light inside the box. The utterly beautiful designs cut in the box are reflective of geometric patterns and ornamentation found in Islamic art and mosques. Her interactive work, inherently religious in inspiration, provides a space open to all to reflect on the all-encompassing power of beauty and spirituality. The music program echoes the spirituality and inclusivity of the art. Opening with the meditative and introspective ‚ÄúFratres‚Äù by Arvo P√§rt, the concert is followed by a work from the Shepherd School‚Äôs own Ben Morris ‚Äô17, entitled ‚ÄúMuqarnas Projections,‚Äù for three violins. The concert continues with a string quartet, ‚ÄúThe Named Angels,‚Äù by Arab-American composer Mohammed Fairouz, whose work is also influenced by Islam as well as Middle-Eastern folklore. Finally, the program concludes with a work by Karim Al-Zand, associate professor of composition and theory at the Shepherd School. His piece, ‚ÄúStudies in Nature,‚Äù is for harp, viola and flute. It is contemplation on the marriage of art and science, directly influenced by remarkably aesthetic color plates of organisms in intricate detail.

Written by: LIONEL BART

Is it worth the waiting for,
If we live till eighty-four
All we ever get is gruel,
Every day we say our prayers
Will they change the bill of fair?
Still we get the same old gruel
There's not a crust not a crumb
Can we find can we beg can we borrow or cadge,
But there's nothing to stop us from getting a thrill,
When we all close our eyes and imagine,

Food glorious food
Hot sausage and mustard
While we're in the mood cold jelly and custard
Pease pudding and saveloys
What next is the question?
Rich gentlemen have it boys
IN-DI-GESTION

Food glorious food
What is there more handsome
Gulped swallowed or chewed
Still worth a kings ransom
What is it we dream about?
What brings on a sigh?
Piled peaches and cream about six feet high

Food glorious food
Were anxious to try it
3 banquets a day
Our favourite diet
Just picture a great big steak fried, roasted or chewed
For food marvelous food wonderful food magical food fabulous food beautiful food

Title: On Computational Thinking, Inferential Thinking and Data Science

Date: September 26, 2017
Time: 4:10pm to 5:00pm
Locations: BIDS, 190 Doe Library, UC Berkeley

ABSTRACT
The rapid growth in the size and scope of datasets in science and technology has created a need for novel foundational perspectives on data analysis that blend the inferential and computational sciences. That classical perspectives from these fields are not adequate to address emerging problems in Data Science is apparent from their sharply divergent nature at an elementary level---in computer science, the growth of the number of data points is a source of ""complexity"" that must be tamed via algorithms or hardware, whereas in statistics, the growth of the number of data points is a source of ""simplicity"" in that inferences are generally stronger and asymptotic results can be invoked. On a formal level, the gap is made evident by the lack of a role for computational concepts such as ""runtime"" in core statistical theory and the lack of a role for statistical concepts such as ""risk"" in core computational theory. I present several research vignettes aimed at bridging computation and statistics, including the problem of inference under privacy and communication constraints, and including a surprising cameo role for symplectic geometry.

Hey cruisers! Thanks for joining us for our first ever LIVE cruise pack with me video. We are driving to port, not flying, so this is not considered a packing light cruise.

lY6wH6sXjmA,Packing Carry On Only For A 12 Night Cruise - Men&#39;s Edition,"Hi Cruisers, It's time for another of our Packing Carry On Only videos. This time we really have a packing challenge ahead of us. We are doing a 12 night Asia cruise on the Diamond Princess, with a very long flight included.  Don't forget our wonderful sponsor: https://cruiseline.com?utm_source=youtube&utm_campaign=cttv
 
If you've watched any of our previous videos, you know that when driving to port we tend to be pretty relaxed with our cruise packing. Some would say I'm am an over-packer. But when we fly it's a whole different story. We don't want to deal with baggage fees, waiting at luggage carousels, and hauling heavy suitcases around an airport.  On this trip we'll be continuing our habit of packing carry on only for cruises. We are starting to perfect this carry on only strategy, and we've got lots of packing tips for carry on only to share with you.  We'll be splitting the packing into three parts, and this is part one (packing carry on only for men). This time we'll focus solely on carry on only for men (all my husband's stuff), and next we'll do a packing carry on only for a cruise with kids, or maybe packing for women.   If you are working on packing light, carry on only is definitely something you should consider. Packing for a cruise can be stressful, but for us adding airport considerations to the mix makes it that much more daunting.  As always, if you have packing tips, carry on only tips, or any tips you think might be helpful to our wonderful cruising community, please share them in the comments below.

The Emily Cooper Welty Expressive Therapy Center at Akron Children's Hospital is a place of healing, where visual art and music converge as therapy for these young patients. The two-year-old center -- adorned with vibrant calming colors, mosaics depicting characters from nursery rhymes and skylights that fill the room with natural light -- is a relatively new concept in the patient experience but one that hospital staff, administration and patients can hang their hat on as an effective method of treatment. Here's a close look at some of these therapy sessions and their direct benefit to patients and families.",Art and Music

Lyrics:

A man walks down the street
He says why am I soft in the middle now
Why am I soft in the middle
The rest of my life is so hard
I need a photo-opportunity
I want a shot at redemption
Don't want to end up a cartoon
In a cartoon graveyard
Bonedigger Bonedigger
Dogs in the moonlight
Far away my well-lit door
Mr. Beerbelly Beerbelly
Get these mutts away from me
You know I don't find this stuff amusing anymore

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty when you call me
You can call me Al

‚ñ∫ Subscribe: https://goo.gl/DT39UP (Don't forget to turn on deathbell notifications!)
üëï CZsWorld Merch Store: https://goo.gl/UyP76X

The history of The Wendigo from Pet Sematary is quite involved and stretches all the way back as far as the 1600s. The 1989 film version of Pet Sematary leaves out any direction mention of The Wendigo, leaving in only a few loose references. The 2019 remake looks to play a bigger part, but has not yet been released at the time of making this video.

In this video, I'll be covering entire history of the Wendigo from it's introduction in Pet Sematary to the role it may have played in Stephen King's 1999 novel The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon. 

I'll be analysing this monster and discussing what it represents in terms of the story, and explaining how it fits into the universe of Stephen King works.

This will cover some of the similarities and differences between King's Wendigo and the real life legend created by the Algonquin Tribe. We'll also discuss how the Wendigo in the story cursed the Mic Mac burial ground in Ludlow, Maine and how that curse affected people hundreds of years later.

J4qwK1KgL_s,Philippines: Cebu Province: Illegal Gun-Manufacturing Centre - 1997,"Cebu province in the Philippines is known for its beautiful beaches and resorts.

But Cebu is known to Filipinos for its illegal gun-manufacturing centred in the city of  Danao.

Recently, the government has approved licences for two gun manufacturing companies  in Danao.

But some remain in operation even without a permit, and this is likely to continue.

UPSOUND: (Sound of rapid gunfire from Uzi-gram)

Byron Garcia is testing what he calls an ""uzi-gram"".

It's one of the products being manufactured by the Danao Arms Manufacturing  Corporation, or Damcor - the first licensed gun manufacturer in Danao City.

The city of Danao, in the Philippine central island of Cebu, has always been notorious  as the centre of illegal gun manufacturing.

Here, thousands of residents have been involved for decades in what is virtually  considered a cottage industry, making home-made guns, popularly known as ""paltik"".

By establishing Damcor, Garcia has legalised gun manufacturing in Danao. 

Damcor specialises on the 38-revolver, and is also producing machine pistols and  shotguns mainly to supply the country's security agencies.

Garcia has invested more than 40 (m) million pesos in Damcor, some of which were  spent on machines with state of the art  technology to produce some of the gun parts.

But most of the work is left for the 70 workers that Garcia has employed since his  company opened last year.

Most of their experience is based on what they've been clandestinely doing in their  backyard for years.

30-year old Lito Gonzales was into illegal gun making for ten years before he decided to  work for Damcor.  

Here, he earns about 600-dollars a month, and is free from the anxiety of being arrested  by the authorities.

SOUNDBITE: (Tagalog) 
""Now, we're okay here, because we don't need to worry about being arrested today or  tomorrow, that the police will arrest us because it's illegal to do guns outside. No  more.""
SUPER CAPTION:  Lito Gonzales, worker Danao Arms Manufacturing Corporation

But despite the entry of Damcor and another licensed gun company, Garcia believes  that the illegal gun- manufacturing industry in Danao will continue to flourish, mainly  because of the lack of political will to remove it.

SOUNDBITE:  (English) 
""Maybe it will change a bit. But it cannot totally eradicate the illegal business here.""
SUPER CAPTION:  Byron Garcia, President Danao Arms Manufacturing Corporation

And for most of the illegal gun makers in this city, making the ""paltik"" in their  backyards will surely be a hard habit to break.

For 20-year-old Julius Capuyan, it's the only job he's known since he was 13 years old.

SOUNDBITE:  (Tagalog) 
""There's no other way of life for us here. We'd rather live this way, illegally making guns.
SUPER CAPTION:  Julius Capuyan

Most of the people in Danao have relied on this illegal industry as their livelihood for  decades making the government's job of curbing the unlicensed gun-manufacturing  operations a difficult task.

Title: Convergence in Biomedicine

Summary

Recent professionalization and expansion of the sciences has isolated investigators in different fields such as physics, mathematics, biology and engineering. There is no longer a set of renaissance individuals who have mastered the important frontiers of these diverse fields and can creatively find connections‚Äîthe heart of new transformative breakthroughs. Our societal structures, such as departments of science and engineering, and our governmental agencies, such as National Institute of Health and the Departments of Energy and Defense, each have specific sciences they nurture and different scientific cultures that re-inforce the silo nature of science in the United States. Introduction of the term ‚ÄúConvergence‚Äù over ten years ago highlighted this fragmentation and the benefits for society of more integration of different sciences into biomedical research. Convergence arises when multi-disciplinary teams are supported, collaborations rewarded, and environments made available for training.

         Modern biological sciences originated with the discovery of the structure of DNA by Watson and Crick in 1953. This discovery was a convergent event as Crick as a physicist and Watson a biologist. From this discovery, molecular biology arose leading to the amazing development of genetic engineering in the mid 70s and the sequencing of the human genome around the end of the century. These revolutions in biological sciences gave rise to the biotechnology industry, a re-design of medical education, and advances in healthcare. However, these successes in effect isolated much of biomedical science from other areas of sciences such as computational mathematics, engineering, and physical sciences. In 2010, conversations with faculty and officials at MIT led to a public policy initiative to increase the visibility of the promise of an increased convergence of biomedical sciences with computational, physical, and engineering sciences, for meeting society‚Äôs challenges. This began with a report from the National Academy of Science, ‚ÄúA New Biology for the 21st Century‚Äù in 2010; a MIT White Paper on Convergence in 2011, and an article in Science in 2011 authored with Robert Langer ‚ÄúPromoting Convergence in Biomedical Science‚Äù Science 333:527. MIT‚Äôs leadership encouraged this public policy initiative and embraced convergence, with the most obvious example being the founding of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. Convergence in biomedical science is reality at MIT and becoming a reality across the country, but more slowly than many had hoped. One of its major promises is the integration of large data with other technologies and advances, thereby creating new opportunities for increasing the quality of healthcare at a sustainable cost.

""Sketch History - Neues von gestern"" ist die neue Sketchcomedy rund um das Thema Weltgeschichte. In zehn knapp halbst√ºndigen Folgen nimmt die Sketchcomedy den Zuschauer mit auf eine unterhaltsame Reise durch die Geschichte der Menschheit. Die Reise geht von den Urzeitmenschen √ºber die Renaissance, die wilden 70er bis hin zum Mauerfall. Die letzten Minuten im Bunker 1945 werden genauso beleuchtet wie die Hintergr√ºnde des Kennedy-Attentats oder die Umst√§nde, die zur Meuterei auf der Bounty f√ºhrten.

""Sketch History - Neues von gestern"" zeigt in einer wahren Bilder- und Kost√ºmschlacht, wie Geschichte zu dem wurde, was sie niemals war. Zeigt, dass hinter Kennedys ber√ºhmtem G√§nsehaut-Satz ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" eigentlich nur ein Tippfehler steckt. Und dass ganz nebenbei die Welt an den Rand eines Atomkriegs geriet, weil dem amerikanischen Pr√§sidenten pers√∂nliche Ferkeleien wichtiger waren als die Schweinebucht. Die einzelnen, immer bildopulenten Sketche springen, verbunden durch auff√§llige Animationen, wild durch die Epochen und zeigen, auch dank Special Effects, Maske, Kost√ºm, CGI, die wirklich wahre Geschichten hinter der Weltgeschichte.",History
VhefABRqNIg,Planning for travel: How I plan for a trip + Q&amp;A,"I like to travel, but before I can go anywhere I have to plan the journey.  In this LIVE video I share my method for travel planning and tips to hopefully make it easier for you.

Show notes:
Big trip: 3-12 months out

Little trip: 3 weeks prior

First thing: Decide on the destination and roughly the timeframe.

I usually have a ""set"" of destinations in mind. 

Flight considerations:: Flight cost, Flight duration (connections), Airline, Alliance, Class of Service, Revenue or Award

If an award ticket always the saver ticket, usually business class.  Make sure to check other airlines website for availability and CALL.  Partner airlines almost always have the best availability.

Award tickets: Think of creative routings, look at an airline route map, SAN to NRT on JAL, LAX to VIE on Austrian

United miles: At least 3 cents per mile

If booking on short notice what seats are available?  Exit row economy plus?

What are the ontime statistics for the flight?  Tip: Early morning flights are the most ontime.  High revenue flights also most ontime.

Might I be changing the flights quite a bit?  Then Southwest -- no change fees.

Tools I use: Kayak, Google Flights, ITA Matrix, Airline Websites (actual and partner), and calling the airline.

Use month long views, flexible dates, pick some random specific dates and write down the best ones.

Picking a hotel:
Start with TripAdvisor
Read FlyerTalk threads
Look for blog reviews on the hotel

I like Marriott&Sheraton, Hyatt, Hilton (in that order).  Best Western and Holiday Inn basically don't exist for me.  Radisson nice internationally.

I tend towards large business hotels, but also like the boutique mini chains, Autograph Collection and Andaz.

I avoid domestic Courtyards like the plague.

Factors for hotel decision: Cost, Quiet rooms, Good AC, Good Location (public transport), Good and cheap (free?) Breakfast, Lounge access, close to restaurants & grocery store.

For big chain hotels I always book thru the hotel website.  For international trips often Expedia.  For Japan: Rakuten.

Tip:. Check special hotel rates: AAA, Senior, other?

Some hotels have bizarre minimum stay requirements (Andaz Maui I'm talking about you!)

I almost always book refundable and changeable hotel reservations.

If I don't know specific cities yet, I'll start with a full booking at arrival airport city and shorten reservation later.

Buy a few travel books -- Rick Steves for Europe.  Select from the most popular on Amazon.

Watch YouTube videos.  Read wikitravel,
Look for other people's itinerary for similar trip length.

Develop general itinerary in Google Docs.  Also Google keep. Detailed down to what city per day and where we sleep.  What mode of transport? Car, train, plane?

Generally at least 2 nights in a hotel, prefer 3.  Generally prefer trains, then car, then planes

Make new hotel bookings or change if new destinations.  Check prices of existing reservations.

A month out: Book train tickets or buy rail passes.  Print out ideal train times.  Determine airport to hotel transportation.  Print out major attraction info.

Right before I go: Check the weather -- Make sure I've packed appropriately.  Also be on the lookout for possible weather delays.  Change flights if Weather Advisory allows.  Check hotel prices again, change to non refundable if available.  Make sure I have enough money in my ATM card account.  Download Google maps offline.

Night before: Decide which travel buddies are going..  Finish final packing of luggage.

After a hiatus, London electronic Jazz outfit Portico Quartet has returned with a new album, and we have them in studio to play two tracks from the record, 'Endless' and 'A Luminous Beam.' Their compositions meld acoustic and electronic soundscapes, jungle-style breakbeats and loose percussive grooves. As the title of current album ""Art In The Age Of Automation"" suggests, they're not interested in musical regression, but rather in ""What it means to make music in the modern age, to mix human art and computer art.""

On Day 27 in Lisbon, Portugal, I made up my mind to eat as much Portuguese food and at some of the best local restaurants in Lisbon. It turned out to be a fantastic day in Lisbon with some seriously good Portuguese food!

00:36 Cafe Martinho Da Arcada at Pra√ßa do Com√©rcio - The first place we stopped in the morning is a legendary cafe in Lisbon that is the oldest cafe in Lisbon called Cafe Martinho Da Arcada. The main reason I wanted to go there was to try their past√©is de bacalhau, classic Portuguese food codfish fritters. The coffee and ambience and of the cafe was also nice. Total price - 9.30 EUR

Restaurante Z√© da Mouraria (I think it was closed for holidays) - I really wanted to eat at this restaurant during my visit to Lisbon, but unfortunately they were closed for holidays, so if you go to Lisbon and are looking for local Portuguese food, check this place out.

5:32 Restaurante Cantinho do Aziz - For our next meal, although not Portuguese food, but more Mozambican food, we headed over to Restaurante Cantinho do Aziz. The food was remarkable, one of the best meals I had in Lisbon. I first began with some beef samosas which were insanely good, and then had spicy bakra piri piri, spicy lamb ribs. Total price - 35.00 EUR

11:14 Restaurante A Merendinha do Arco - Finally, to try some authentic Portuguese food in Lisbon, we headed over to a restaurant called Restaurante A Merendinha do Arco. This small family run restaurant serves delicious Portuguese food and many of the classics. I ordered bacalhau com gr√£o, codfish with garbanzo beans and carne de porco √† alentejana, pork with clams. Along with the delicious local food, what I loved was the ambiance and feel of the restaurant. Total price - 20.15 EUR

22:10 Ocean√°rio de Lisboa (Entrance price - 17 EUR per person) - By this point on this Portuguese food tour of Lisbon, I was feeling pretty full, so we headed over to Ocean√°rio de Lisboa and walked around one of Europe‚Äôs biggest aquariums.

24:22 Cafe on Avenida da Liberdade (Coffee - 1.40 EUR) - One of the things I love about Lisbon is the social cafe culture and atmosphere. In the afternoon I was starting to feel pretty sleepy, so before dinner, I had a cup of coffee at an outdoor cafe along Avenida.

25:12 Solar dos Presuntos - For the last Portuguese meal in on this food tour of restaurants in Lisbon, I decided to eat at a restaurants called Solar dos Presuntos. I didn‚Äôt know it was going to be such a fancy high end restaurant, but it was our last night in Lisbon, so we decided to go for it. I started with the pata negra, a plate of incredibly good ham. Then I ordered the polvo √† lagareiro, some of the most tender octopus I‚Äôve ever had in my life. Finally we also ordered dourada grelhada - gilt-head sea bream fish. The food was expensive, but delicious. Total price - 60.85 EUR.

This was a fantastic day of Portuguese food in Lisbon, and many of the places we ate today were the best restaurants I tried in Lisbon.

I Fall Apart ‚Äì Post Malone Lyrics:

[Intro]
Oooh, I fall apart
Oooh, yeah, mmhmm

[Verse 1]
She told me that I'm not enough, yeah
And she left me with a broken heart, yeah
She fooled me twice and it's all my fault, yeah
She cut too deep, now she left me scarred, yeah
Now there's too many thoughts goin' through my brain, yeah
And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine, yeah

[Chorus]
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

[Verse 2]
Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go
Everybody told me, so
Feelin' like I sold my soul
Devil in the form of a wh*re
Devil in the form of a wh*re
You said it
No, you said it
No, you said it
We'd be together

[Chorus]
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

[Bridge]
Ice keep pourin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
Covered in scars and I can't help showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep blowin'
Ice keep droppin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
All these scars, can't help from showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep blowin', yeah

[Chorus]
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

Of course, we didn‚Äôt include every tool company in this video. Honestly, we didn't have the time! We did, however, do our best to include as many tool brand parent companies as possible. Starting with several of the largest manufacturers who likely own more brands than you think.

In the 14th century a Muslim historian named Ibn Khaldun wrote about the pattern of history. Farmers would build irrigation systems supporting villages and towns. Later some warrior would bring these towns under his rule and form a united political entity, like a kingdom or an empire. Then a tribe of nomads would come along and conquer the kingdom, seize all the holdings and settle in their place and further expand the new empire. As time went by the nomads would assimilate and become soft city dwellers. Exactly the kind of people they had conquered and at this point another tribe of nomads would come along and conquer them and take their empire. Conquest, consolidation, expansion, degeneration and conquest, this was the pattern of history.

The human body runs on food.  Once, food shortage was the major concern.  After the second world war, technological advances in food production led to a new era, that was characterized by an overabundance of inexpensive food, and relatively little physical activity.  In the decades that followed, other sociocultural shifts continued to contribute to the changing way we ate.  Women who had previously controlled most of the average family's food preparation now entered the workforce in significant numbers.  And the processed food industry began to capitalize on our need for fast, convenient food.  

This meant that fewer meals were being cooked at home.  And since convenience foods were generally higher in calories than home-cooked meals, the average person's caloric intake increased dramatically.

Maya Adam, MD, is waging a battle cry against one of America‚Äôs most critical ‚Äì and challenging ‚Äì public health crises of our generation: childhood obesity. A lecturer at Stanford School of Medicine and in Stanford University‚Äôs human biology program, she is leading the cause through education.

P&G is a fast-moving consumer goods company. We have several different BUs. So we handle the whole spectrum of a person's life stages.

Digital tools are simply critical for us to be able of the
delivering this manufacturing of the future. 

Two and a half years ago we watched the technician re-enter data from one system to the next system for the next system.  It was so disempowering. They were very frustrated that the systems weren't integrated.  We needed a solution that could really scale with us.

The way we operate the business the way people learn is different. And, we have to be ready for that.

Our vision is that each operation team has a tool in their hand
to improve their business results.

Out on the lines on to tablets so they can interact with the data real time at the point that they need to not over back over the desk. Because the work doesn't happen at the desk. Work happens at the piece of equipment.

From our team rooms we went away from you know hard written
paper or single desk typing to touchscreen technology so they can get there and drag new data around. It blew me away.

One of the primary benefit is the flexibility you get in a platform solution. In terms of time savings, energy savings, we're going to at least see 45-minute pressure per line per business unit.

It has the flexibility to look at the same data in different ways that make sense for that particular operational team at that particular time.

The KPIs from that digital platform really help us visualize the operational level. Including process reliability which is really efficiency of the operations, safety and quality.

Too often we provide a solution that is limited.

I'm very confident in GE's ability to expand this outside the factory walls to look at the entire supply chain. 
 
The people that we have worked with at GE when they say they're going to do something they really deliver excellence and they deliver it on time.",Manufacturing

F7flSW1PGsA,Progressive Presidents: Crash Course US History #29,"In which John Green teaches you about the Progressive Presidents, who are not a super-group of former presidents who create complicated, symphonic, rock soundscapes that transport you into a fantasy fugue state. Although that would be awesome. The presidents most associated with the Progressive Era are Theodore Roosevelt, William Taft, and Woodrow Wilson. During the times these guys held office, trusts were busted, national parks were founded, social programs were enacted, and tariffs were lowered. It wasn't all positive though, as their collective tenure also saw Latin America invaded A LOT, a split in the Republican party that resulted in a Bull Moose, all kinds of other international intervention, and the end of the Progressive Era saw the United States involved in World War. If all this isn't enough to entice, I will point out that two people get shot in this video. Violence sells, they say.

DhuuOWteelc,Project Tinkertoy (IC Precursor) 1953 US Navy; Automated Manufacturing of Modular Electronics,"Support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/jeffquitney

Electronics playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAA9B0175C3E15B47

more at: http://scitech.quickfound.net

Project Tinkertoy was an effort begun in 1950 by the US National Bureau of Standards to devise a system for automated manufacturing of electronic devices built up from modular subsystem components. The resulting products were not smaller or lighter than hand-assembled electronics of the time, but were thought to be more reliable and required less skilled labor. The basic unit for circuit construction was a ceramic ""wafer"" upon which the machine produced circuit components were mounted.

Originally a public domain film from the US Navy, slightly cropped to remove uneven edges, with the aspect ratio corrected, and one-pass brightness-contrast-color correction & mild video noise reduction applied.
The soundtrack was also processed with volume normalization, noise reduction, clipping reduction, and/or equalization (the resulting sound, though not perfect, is far less noisy than the original).

Tinkertoy Modulization of Electronic Circuits by Harold Belmont Price (1953) https://archive.org/details/tinkertoymoduliz00pric

...The National Bureau of Standards during World War II developed 
printed circuits to permit rapid production of VT proximity fuzes 
which were required in large numbers for use in gun projectiles. With the methods used in this development it was found that the percentage yield of acceptable circuits was undesirably low where several lumped components were printed as part of the circuit. To partially offset this shortcoming adhesive tape resistors... were developed. Many different printed circuit techniques have been used since information concerning the VT fuze development was first released in February of 1946...

...with the exception of the Sargrove venture in producing a relatively simple circuit no attempt has been made to completly machine produce an equipment from bulk or slightly machined materials. The Bureau of Aeronautics became aware of the possibilities of developing such a system and in June 1950 inaugurated the Tinkertoy project as an Industry Preparedness Measure Project...

The system developed for use in Tinkertoy makes use of ceramic 
wafers upon which the machine produced circuit components are mounted. Riser wires are soldered to notches in the wafer edges for holding the wafers in parallel stacks and for providing electrical connections required to the various components. Each module, as the stacks of wafers are called, generally includes the vacuum tube and associated circuitry required by one stage of the circuit. The modules are secured between top and bottom baseplates which are etched with the necessary circuitry for connecting the modules electrically. The Tinkertoy system at present is limited to production of these plate assemblies which in general contain the circuitry of functional subassemblies. A complete equipment will usually contain several plate assemblies plus mechanical parts and any conventional components 
which are not adaptable to modulization...

The circuit components are mounted on the modular wafers which are the key to the Tinkertoy system of construction. The wafer is a square ceramic plate which is about seven-eighths of an inch on a side and about one-sixteenth of an inch thick. Three equally spaced notches on each edge are designed to receive the riser wires which are soldered to the wafer in assembly of the module. A fourth notch placed between two of the riser wire notches on one edge is provided for use in indexing the wafers to the correct orientation during the assembling processes...",Manufacturing

U7kL-Li6U9o,Pseudo-Science and Academic Freedom,"There's a tense debate in academia about what should be taught and researched within the University. Climate change denial, anti-vaccination, astrology, intelligent design, homeopathy, spiritual ways of knowing, telekinesis, UFOs, that intelligence and aptitude vary by race, that HIV is not the cause of AIDS - each of these, and more, have defenders in the Academy. 

Does academic freedom protect teaching, researching, and expressing positions entirely at odds with majority or consensus views in science? Is there a cost or harm to public health or social justice?

dSMiYzBEPY8,Psychosocial programs like art therapy and music therapy help heal kids faster,"Childhood cancer is a family disease in that it affects the life of patients and their parents and siblings. Cancer can also significantly impact a child's psychosocial state - their emotions, behaviors, thoughts. A child's psychosocial state also impacts his or her relationships with family, friends, peers, etc. 

Art therapy and music therapy are just two of the many programs our staff offers to patients with cancer. These programs help patients express their emotions in a healthy, effective way. They also serve as a distraction when things get especially difficult during treatment or in the hospital.

Our therapists are nationally certified and offer the best possible care to our patients and often times engage the entire family in sessions.

The theme for ISC-2019 is 'Future India-Science and Technology' and it will be hosted by the Lovely Professional University (PLU), Jalandhar from January 3-7, a statement said. During the five-day-long ISC, around 100 plus conferences and events of scientific and technological origin will also be held, where scientists, senior officials from DRDO, ISRO, Department of Science and Technology, AIIMS, UGC, AICTE, and many elite universities of the US, UK, India and other countries will participate, the statement added.

Union Cabinet ministers, including Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan and Textile Minister Smriti Irani, will also attend the event.

""The government's aim is to deliver the benefits of science and technology to the last man in the society. Scientists being a pivot should put their heart and soul into finding new solutions to the problems facing the nation and improve the quality of life of common man,"" Vardhan said in his message.


The participating Nobel laureates include biochemist Thomas Sudoph, who was awarded the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on vesicle trafficking, Nobel laureate in Chemistry Avram Hershko and, and Frederick Duncan Michael Haldane who was awarded 2016 Nobel Prize in Physics.

The Children's Science Congress will be inaugurated on Friday. Near 150 science projects finalised by the DST are to be showcased, and children will also have the opportunity to listen, interact with eminent scientists and nobel laureates. On the third day of ISC, two-day Science Communicators' Meet 2019 will be inaugurated, where the main aim will be to brainstorm ways of dissemination of scientific information and inculcation of scientific attitude among masses. The Women's Science Congress, to be inaugurated on January 5 will showcase the contribution of women in science, technology and the society.

Some of the past ISCs have witnessed controversies over the kind of papers that were presented there. In the last ISC at Manipur, Vardhan received flak over his comments that cosmologist Stephen Hawking had said Vedas have superior theory than Albert Einstein's e=mc2.

2k3PRrod2JY,Retained Searches for careers in food science and technology,"Retained Searches for careers in food science and technology
http://www.foodscience.com/retained-search/index.html

Retained Search Services

OPUS International. Inc. has earned a reputation as being one of, if not the most respected search firm in the food science industry. Based on our results and our strong belief in ethical business practices we are highly thought of and trusted across the industry.

As a result of this trust, many clients now enlist our services on a retainer basis as opposed to (or in addition to) our standard contingency search services. Retained search assignments are on a contract basis only. Under the contract, we first endeavor to gain a thorough understanding of the client‚Äôs organization and of their positional requirements before commencing our search.  From this we seek to create as comprehensive job outline as possible and a candidate criteria list from which to begin our search for that perfect square peg to fit the square hole in the client‚Äôs organization.

Retained searches often require us to identify and evaluate potential candidates who are not necessarily currently active in the job market. To identify and approach such requires a skill set we have spent years in developing and our professionalism at all times has contributed greatly to our longevity and success. Where possible, our goal is to provide a minimum of three potential and highly qualified prospects for any given position.  Our efforts greatly reduce the cost of our client‚Äôs management and human resources time investment and it is often easier for an independent third party recruiter, especially one with visibility such as ours, to make the initial discrete approach to a suitable and potential target employee.

Under our retained search policies we deem it necessary and ethical to provide a guarantee of finding the successful client and to offer our Off-Limits Policy.

Some of our recent placements include:

    Vice President, Research and Development
    Vice President, Quality Assurance
    Vice President, Technology
    Vice President, Engineering
    Senior Director, New Technologies
    Senior Director, R&D
    Senior Director, Food Safety

Off-Limits Policy

From the date that a Retained Search Contract is signed by a client, we guarantee that we will not recruit senior executives (or other pre-defined positions or levels) for the duration of the contract or a period of 1 year from the time at which the contract goes into effect, whichever is the longer. We reserve the right to negate this policy in the event of cancellation of the contract before the search is completed, non-payment of fees and/or expenses due, or changes in the client organization‚Äôs ownership that affects the contact and our relationship with the client.  Also, under our Off-Limits Policy, any candidate placed into the client‚Äôs employ as the result of any contract with OPUS International, Inc., will not be targeted for future recruitment by OPUS International, Inc. while he or she remains in the client‚Äôs employ.  Additional terms and conditions to our Off-Limits Policy may be requested by the client. Should such clauses be required, OPUS International, Inc. can be counted on to provide complete secrecy and discretion.

XQChad04dPU,RI Seminar: Daniel D. Lee : Manifolds and Decision Making in Intelligent Systems,"Daniel D. Lee
Professor, University of Pennsylvania

January 15, 2016

Abstract
Current AI systems for perception and action incorporate a number of techniques: optimal observer models, Bayesian filtering, probabilistic mapping, trajectory planning, dynamic navigation, and feedback control. I will describe and demonstrate some of these methods for autonomous driving and legged and flying robots, and contrast these models with neural representations and computation in biology. I will also highlight some new research on machine learning for these systems, and discuss the role of geometrical structures and noise in synthetic and biological approaches to classification and decision making.

bHCAtFUIaFU,RI Seminar: Michael Wang : From Compliant Mechanisms to Hyper-Elastic Robots,"RI Seminar: Michael Wang
From Compliant Mechanisms to Hyper-Elastic Robots

Professor, Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore

September 12, 2014

Abstract
Compliant mechanisms provide kinematic solutions for transferring or transforming motion or force in a mechatronic system. Rather than relying on sliding or rolling motion as in traditional mechanics, compliant mechanisms produce their mobility based on the deflection of flexible members. This enables the integration of multiple functions into simple topologies, by embedding sensors and actuators to build fully functional and distributed devices capable of complex tasks. Further, the simple topologies in structural, mechanical, and electronic integration could lend themselves to advanced manufacturing techniques such as 3D printing with materials specialized in electro-mechanical sensing and actuation in addition to structural support, such as electroactive polymers and nanoparticle composites. Compliant mechanisms show promise for developing soft robots in addressing many pressing needs such as next generation medical implants and biomimetic medical devices.

This presentation describes an overview of a class of such compliant mechatronic systems and methods for their design and fabrication. It focuses on a computation method for designing compliant mechanisms with distributed compliance and/or made of multiple materials. It also presents an overview of exploratory solutions to modeling of soft continuum, hyper-elastic simulation for soft robots, distributed control of soft actuators (polymers or fluids), strategies for soft manipulation and locomotion, and rapid prototyping and fabrication of hyper-elastic robots.

4PE-QyHBLW8,RI Seminar: Zexiang Li : From Geometry to Startups -The Rise of a New Robotics Industry in China,"Zexiang Li
Professor, Hong Kong University of Science & Technology

March 07, 2014

Abstract
Many problems in robotics, mechanism design and manufacturing research are geometric in nature: Rigid body motion, modeling, analysis and synthesis of both open-chain and closed-chain manipulators, grasping and manipulation with multifingered robotic hands, tolerance formulation and verification, design and control of five- axes machines, etc.In this talk, I will present an effort, which was initiated by R. Brockett of Harvard about 30 years ago, and continued by the Berkeley group and then my own group at HKUST for the last 20 years to develop a unified theory, using tools from differentiable manifolds and Lie groups, for robotics, mechanism design and manufacturing research. First, using intuitive examples, I will recollect some of the basic concepts of differentiable manifolds and their ""engineering"" classifications. Then, I will show how problems in robotics,mechanism design and manufacturing research can be modeled using various types of manifolds as 
their model spaces. Finally, I will highlight how geometric properties of these spaces are being exploited to provide more efficient solutions for optimization problems defined on these spaces.

I will describe how results from this research program are being used as basis for founding of three companies, one in motion control, one in UAV-based consumer products and the other in assembly automation for 3C products. Burrowing from L. Page's words, I credit this effort to ""Geometry as inspiration."" There are grand opportunities for robotic research in China. However, the biggest challenge lies in the creation of an eco-system that foster growth of many more startups from our research and teaching programs. A new robotics institute is being proposed at HKUST for such a purpose.

‚Üí Who are we? 

Hey there! We are Greg and Hillary ‚Äì a husband and wife team that loves traveling, going on adventures, and helping others do the same! Although we love traveling, at this point in time, we still have full time 9-5 jobs in Dallas, Texas.
In August of 2016, we packed up our things, Greg quit his job, and we moved to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico! 
Hillary is working remotely for her CPA firm and Greg is working on this site full time. 
We view ourselves as fairly ordinary people, complete with an ordinary income, ordinary jobs, and (unfortunately) an ordinary amount of student loan debt (thanks UNT!).
I know what you are thinking, ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt travel blogs supposed to be written by hippies that don‚Äôt have jobs and live in hostels?!‚Äù Well don‚Äôt you worry, we are working on making that happen! Although we hope to become full time travelers in the next 1-2 years, this site is not necessarily aimed at people that want to travel full time.
Our hope is not that you quit your job and become a long haired, bearded, Volkswagen van driving hippy. Instead, our hope is that after reading our stories you are more inspired to live a more fulfilling life from 5pm-9am!
Why such the emphasis on how ordinary we are? Although we love reading travel blogs, it is easy to feel disconnected from the writers at times. It seems as though they are leading such extraordinary lives that they are somehow doing something that is unreachable to the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù person.  

We are here to prove that wrong. We are here to tell you that even if you work a full-time job and only get two weeks of vacation each year-you still have the power to design an adventurous life for yourself. Afterall, that is exactly where we started before leaving it all behind to live la vida loca! 
After having several caffeine induced conversations about how people should travel more and shift their priorities in a way that will lead to a more fulfilling life, we decided to share our stories with you.
Our purpose in creating Kinetic Kennons is to share our stories of travels, adventures, and funny mishaps and to inspire others to design a life full of exploration. Throughout this site you will find posts about how to go on a cheap weekend trip, funny stories such as the time Hillary forgot to update her passport before an international trip, and inspirational rants on why you should lead a more adventurous life!",Travel

‚ú©OUR STORY: Backroads of Montana. Watch Video here: http://tinyurl.com/jr2efug

I'm originally from Fier, Albania. I grew up in Roskovec until I finished the 8th grade and then immigrated to Italy on my own to look for work opportunities. I ended up being taken in by a school for boys without families, ""Fondazione il Faro"", in Rome. There, they tried to integrate us into the community by teaching us the Italian language as well as giving us technical skills like making pizza, cutting hair, carpentry and computer programming. After a year at the school, I found my first job as a waiter in a vegetarian restaurant. The work was challenging and I loved it. I waited tables for the next six years, working at renowned Roman restaurants learning a great deal about Italian food and wine in the process.

In 2004, I met my wife, Kaleigh, a Montana native, who was a student traveling and studying in Rome...

She is super morbidly obese and addicted to food. Sacha lives with her nine-year old son, Lewis, who is also overweight. Her weight is ruining her life - she is so ashamed of her size, she refuses to get out of the car when she picks up Lewis from school - fearing he will get bullied as a result. Her decision to undergo surgery was prompted by the realisation that she would only survive a maximum of five years without any surgery. She is petrified of dying on the operating table and leaving her son alone.

Transcript:

Save time and money on the production of large-scale, high-value metal (titanium, tantalum, inconel, stainless steel, etc.) parts and prototypes with Sciaky's Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing (EBAM‚Ñ¢) solution.

Transcript:

Imagine: From this, to this, in a fraction of the time and cost it used to take. With Sciaky‚Äôs exclusive Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing, or EBAM‚Ñ¢ for short, metal 3D printing is not limited by part size, material, or geometry. You can manufacture parts and structures that exceed 19 feet in length, 4 feet wide, 4 feet high, and 8 feet in diameter, made from virtually any metal, including inconel and stainless steels, and refractory alloys like titanium and tantalum.  

How does the EBAM‚Ñ¢ process work? Starting with a 3D model from a CAD program, Sciaky‚Äôs fully-articulated, moving electron beam gun deposits metal, from wire feedstock, layer by layer, until the part reaches near-net shape and is ready for finish machining. Deposition rates can range from 7 to 20 pounds of metal per hour, which is significantly more efficient and cost-effective than selective laser sintering processes that utilize messy powders. In addition, a dual wire-feed system can be utilized with the EBAM‚Ñ¢ process to increase deposition efficiency, as well as to easily switch to different deposition materials. 

So, whether you need to produce a functional prototype, or a run of production parts, the possibilities are virtually endless. 

Our technology partners include the Department of Defense, U.S. Air Force, Boeing, DARPA, Penn State University's Applied Research Laboratory and Lockheed Martin.

Call the metal 3D printing experts at Sciaky today and find out how EBAM‚Ñ¢ ‚Äì Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing ‚Äì can save you significant time and money on the production of your critical metal parts.

7:30-9pm: Science-Art Collaboration Roundtable #1
(Mark Rosin, Shane Mayak, Tyler Volk, Noah Hutton, Jame McCray, and Monica Aiello)

Collaboration between the arts and sciences has a rich history dating back to the Renaissance, and recently experienced a resurgence in the 1960s with the art-engineering group Experiments in Art & Technology. Even more recently, artists have begun to actively collaborate with scientists in all disciplines to expand their artistic reach. But collaboration is not a one-sided event, and the benefits of art and design to the fields of science and technology are well known, from Gould‚Äôs drawings of Darwin‚Äôs finches to the success story of Steve Jobs‚Äô Apple projects. Despite its rich history, collaboration has never been a simple process, and remains a difficult task, largely due to disciplinary boundaries emphasized in our educational system. There are many unanswered questions about the nature of collaboration, authorship of a collaborative product, funding for collaborative works, and the future of collaborations in our 21st century that warrant discussion. This roundtable topic will address these, and more questions on collaboration across the arts and sciences.
What does it mean to collaborate? What can art-science-tech collaborations result in? How does this work get funded? How can we ensure collaboration is not just a buzzword? Who owns a collaboration? Can art influence science as science influences art, and should it? What does the future of collaboration look like?",Science and Technology

ZTC_RxWN_xo,Secret History of Silicon Valley,"[Recorded: November 20, 2008]

Today, Silicon Valley is known around the world as a fount of technology innovation and development fueled by private venture capital and peopled by fabled entrepreneurs. But it wasn't always so. Unbeknownst to even seasoned inhabitants, today's Silicon Valley had its start in government secrecy and wartime urgency.

In this lecture, renowned serial entrepreneur Steve Blank presents how the roots of Silicon Valley sprang not from the later development of the silicon semiconductor but instead from the earlier technology duel over the skies of Germany and secret efforts around (and over) the Soviet Union. World War II, the Cold War and one Stanford professor set the stage for the creation and explosive growth of entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley. The world was forever changed when the Defense Department, CIA and the National Security Agency acted like today's venture capitalists funding this first wave of entrepreneurship. Steve Blank shows how these groundbreaking early advances lead up to the high-octane, venture capital fueled Silicon Valley we know today.

OlwsJWkgu7k,Secret History of the Freemasons ~ Full Documentary,"The first president of the United States, George Washington, was a Mason, along with 13 other presidents and numerous Supreme Court Justices. Benjamin Franklin published a book about Freemasonry on his own printing press. Nine signers of the Declaration of Independence were Freemasons, including the man with the biggest signature: Jon Hancock...

Suspected throughout their long history of plotting to overtake the world accused of fomenting revolution and reviled as devil worshippers that stole King Solomon's treasure the Freemasons claim they're merely a civic-minded fraternity bound together by harmless rituals. Our high-energy cocktail of dramatic reenactment expert interviews and on-location footage entertains historians Akram Elias Stephen Bullock and Brent Morris to retell the Freemasons' central myth concerning Hiram Abiff mythical builder of Jerusalem's Temple of Solomon. During construction he was killed by three workers who believed his ""secret"" would impart magical powers--representing the three evils against which Freemasons believe they're still struggling: ignorance fanaticism and tyranny. Today the world's 2.5 million Freemasons meet to reenact the ritual of Hiram's murder as the initiation ceremony for the main rank of Master Mason.AMERICA: Is America the creation of the Freemasons? For hundreds of years suspicions of a plot to take over America have swirled around the Freemasons the world's oldest secret society. Freemasons led the Revolution framed the Declaration of Independence and Constitution designed our nation's capitaland in the early years of the Republic grew to unmatched heights of influence and power. The untold story of the Freemasons in America reveals secret codes patterns in the sky murder and a radically new picture of the nation's Founding Fathers.",History

eBwluaTaenI,Secure Development for Snake People - Leigh/Ari of Slack - Duo Tech Talk,"Startups hear the word ‚Äúprocess"" and freak out - shipping code every day isn't optional. What if you could build a secure development process that accelerated development, instead of slowing it down? At Slack, we have - allowing our small team to distribute security work to developers, and building up their security skills from intern to senior engineer. We'll talk through the tools and processes we built - a flexible framework including a lightweight self-service assessment tool, a checklist generator, and most importantly a chat-based process that meets people where they are already working. Together, these encourage security thinking in the tools developers already spend their time in - allowing us to effortlessly document people's thought processes around risk. By empowering developers to think about security themselves and incorporate secure practices into their own teams and workflows, we've defeated the fear of the checkbox and replaced it with new tooling and process that teams actually want to work with.

Speakers:

Ari Rubinstein has worked in multiple roles across the security industry including leading the Red Team at Salesforce, developing a Product Security program at Heroku, and now runs the Product Security group at Slack focusing on proactive identification, automation, and education programs. He enjoys participating in numerous bug bounties in his free time and has a special interest in Web Application Security. Ari has advised on security topics for multiple startups and has a Masters of Science from Carnegie Mellon University.

Leigh leads the security incident response team at Slack. Prior to Slack, she worked at Salesforce, Microsoft, and Symantec. She has co-founded two hackerspaces, and is an advisor to several nonprofits and startups. Leigh has a Bachelors of Science from the University of Toronto where she majored in Computer Science and Equity Studies.",Science and Technology

QElSrzD9eaI,Selling Travel on Social,"Pinterest is becoming a popular way for small businesses to promote their brands and get their names out there. But using Pinterest to successfully market your business by drumming up interest in repining your content isn‚Äôt as easy as it looks. There is more to it than simply having a good product.

43% of social media users have purchased a product after sharing or favoriting it on Pinterest, Facebook or Twitter.

What makes Pinterest the most interesting of the social networking sites is that it is actually oriented around the merchants. The pins are mostly links to cool products that the person likes. There are links to other interesting things, but most of it is for sale.

Businesses are cropping up to exploit Pinterest and generate sales where it would otherwise be difficult. This is the holy grail of social networking for the marketing people out there.

Case study example: Travel Channel - Pinterest is great for finding destinations to visit, things to do, fun travel tips and tools, and lots more. If you‚Äôve got the travel bug, follow the Travel Channel on Pinterest. You‚Äôll find everything from our favorite travel photos, quotes, destinations and travel activities that are on their ‚Äúbucket list.‚Äù They also love to repin interesting travel photos from other Pinners.

Issues to be addressed:

Does purchasing lead to social media sharing, or does social media sharing lead to purchasing?
What are the win strategies for Pinterest?
How to avoid the common mistakes when selling travel on Pinterest?
Learning from best examples on Pinterest.

Q1qPHlGWJDg,Semin√°rio: Quantitative Logic Reasoning,"Marcelo Finger
IME/USP
Quantitative Logic Reasoning
We present a research program which investigates the intersection of deductive reasoning with explicit quantitative capabilities. These quantitative capabilities encompass probabilistic reasoning, counting and counting quantifiers, and similar systems. The need to have a combined reasoning system that enables a unified way of reasoning with quantities has always been recognized in modern logic, as proposals of probabilistic logic reasoning are present since the work of Boole [1854]. Equally ubiquitous is the need to deal with cardinality restrictions on finite sets. More recently, a well-founded probabilistic theory has been developed for non-classical settings as well, such as probabilistic reasoning over ≈Åukasiewicz infinitely-valued logic. We show that there is a common way to deal with these several deductive quantitative capabilities, involving a framework based on Linear Algebras and Linear Programming, The distinction between classical and non-classical probabilistic and cardinality reasoning comes from the different family of algebras employed. The quantitative logic systems are particularly amenable to the introduction of inconsistency measurements, which quantify the degree of inconsistency of a given quantitative logic theory, following some basic principles of inconsistency measurements. On the practical level, we aim at exploring quantitative logic systems in which the complexity of reasoning is ""only NP-complete"". We provide open-source implementations for solvers operating over those systems and study some notable empirical properties, such as the present of a phase transition. This in this talk we concentrate on concepts and examples, aiming at showing that these ideas do have practical applications and decent implementation.

WeSOiKYmfOo,Shakar Sazi || Sugar Manufacturing,"A sugar cane mill can refer to a factory that processes sugar cane to produce raw or white sugar. It can also mean the piece of equipment that crushes the sticks of sugar cane to extract the juice.
There are a number of steps in producing raw sugar from cane:

Cane receiving and unloading (receive the cane at the factory and unload it from the transport vehicles)
Cane preparation (cutting and shredding cane to prepare it for juice extraction)
Juice extraction (two technologies are in common use; milling or diffusion)
Juice clarification (remove suspended solids from the juice, typically mud, waxes, fibres)
Juice evaporation (to concentrate the juice to a thick syrup of about 65¬∞brix)
Syrup clarification (remove suspended solids from the syrup, typically colloid syze of mud, waxes, fibres, etc.)
Crystallisation
Centrifugation (Separation of the sugar crystals from the mother liquor, done by centrifugal machines)
Sugar drying
Packaging and delivery
These processing steps will produce a brown or raw sugar. Mill white sugar also known as plantation white sugar can be produced by introducing some form of colour removal process (often sulphitation) between the juice clarification and the juice evaporation stages mentioned above.The raw sugar produced is often refined to produce white sugar. This sugar refining can be done either at a completely separate factory or at a back-end refinery which is attached to the raw sugar factory.

¬ª THE SEAFOOD

1. DOMANNAKA: Mackerel Sashimi + Uni (Sea Urchin) + Dancing Tiger Shrimp 
ADDRESS: 101-0025 Tokyo, Chiyoda, Kanda Sakumacho 3-37-4 
OPEN: 4PM - 12AM 

ü¶ê Domannaka is based in Hokkaido, Tokyo, with 6 locations across the city. They are known for their unique dishes, primarily seafood served while it is still alive. They offer delicacies such as squid, mackerel and trevally. We tried their living mackerel sashimi, uni (sea urchin) and dancing tiger shrimp.

üí∏PRICE: Mackerel (saba) 8.59 USD/6,980 JPY for whole fish | Uni (sea urchin) USD/2,500 JPY per plate (13-20 sea urchins) | Tiger Shrimp (odorigui) USD/890 JPY per shrimp

2. TAKAMARU FRESH FISH STORE: Oyster + Ankimo (Monkfish Liver) + Anko Nabe (Monkfish Hotpot) + Deep Fried Monkfish 
ADDRESS: 950-1 Oshimata | Seven Park Ario KAshiwa 1F, Kashiwa 277-0922, Chiba Prefecture 
OPEN: 11AM - 9PM

üêüTakamaru Fresh Fish Store serves some of Tokyo‚Äôs finest fish delicacies. Among their delicacies is monkfish, a very rare fish that is hard to find in Tokyo, even in big fish markets. Monkfish liver (ankimo) is typically considered the tastiest part of the fish and was even listed on CNN‚Äôs 2011 list of the World‚Äôs 50 Most Delicious Foods. We were fortunate enough to get a taste of this dish, which is not a typical menu item at Takamaru Fresh Fish Store. Monkfish hotpot is a bit more common than monkfish liver, frequently eaten during the winter months in Japan.

Lyrics:

And another one bites the dust
Oh why can I not conquer love?
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons

Well, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart,
But your blade - it mightbe too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard,
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart

DIL_OOF5FFw,Silicon Manufacturing &amp; The Perfect Wafer | Inside the Fab | Intel,"Meet Dave Pivin, a Failure Analyst Engineer at Intel whose job it is to continuously push towards the production of a perfect silicon wafer. As Dave puts it, it's like ""Looking in a million haystacks for a single needle"". 
 
 As silicon wafer production moves smaller and smaller, from 22 nanometer to 14 nanometer, imperfections in production are tough to see even with high-powered microscopes. Dave and his team of fellow scientists are charged with identifying the causes of these nearly invisible defects. 
 
 Check out Dave's story, and stay tuned for more stories ""Inside the Fab"" at Intel. Subscribe now to Intel on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1BZDtpf

Lyrics:

I am just a poor boy.
Though my story's seldom told,
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles,
Such are promises
All lies and jest
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest.

When I left my home
And my family,
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station,
Running scared,
Laying low,
Seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go,
Looking for the places
Only they would know.",Art and Music

Lyrics:

When you're weary
Feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I will dry them all

I'm on your side
When times get rough
And friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you

I'll take your part
When darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

Sail on Silver Girl,
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
If you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind",Art and Music

Ajn9g5Gsv98,Slavery - Crash Course US History #13,"In which John Green teaches you about America's ""peculiar institution,"" slavery. I wouldn't really call it peculiar. I'd lean more toward horrifying and depressing institution, but nobody asked me. John will talk about what life was like for a slave in the 19th century United States, and how slaves resisted oppression, to the degree that was possible. We'll hear about cotton plantations, violent punishment of slaves, day to day slave life, and slave rebellions. Nat Turner, Harriet Tubman, and Whipped Peter all make an appearance. Slavery as an institution is arguably the darkest part of America's history, and we're still dealing with its aftermath 150 years after it ended.

GEgaV0aFBsg,Solar Cell Manufacturing with Heterojunction Technology,"The heterojunction technology combines the advantages of crystalline silicon solar cells and thin film technologies enabling solar cell to reach higher degrees of efficiency at a lower cost of production.

This movie shows you the process of manufacturing solar cells with heterojunction technology:

Texturing
For high efficiency HJT cells, damages from cutting have to be completely removed and a special texture created by wet chemical processes. The wafers are also put through a special cleaning process.

PECVD Coating
The surface of the cell is passivated  in order to prevent energy loss within the cell. The intrinsic and amorphous silicon layers are separated without cross-contamination, thus achieving passivation with a high longevity.

PVD Coating
A sputter process is used to apply a TCO layer to the front and back of the wafer which serves as an antireflection layer.

Printing
Screen printing is used to print the contacts on the front and back sides of wafers with silver paste.

Curing
Curing printed HJT cells is a simple thermal process in order to outgas the solvents within the low temperature paste.


Testing & Sorting
Meyer Burger offers leading measurement procedures for the precise testing of high capacitance HJT cells which require a measurement speed of 400‚Äì600 ms.",Manufacturing

5iJfy9ipz34,"Space, science and security","With so much of our modern world and its infrastructure reliant on space assets ‚Äì from navigation to telecommunications, earth observation, environmental monitoring and weather forecasting ‚Äì we have become vulnerable to many threats that could have economic and national security consequences. The UK government policy on space security published in 2014 sought to meet these challenges by making the UK more resilient to disruption of space assets whilst enabling UK industry and academia to exploit science and grasp commercial opportunities in support of national space security interests.
 
The UK is not alone in seeking to ensure effective, reliable and efficient access to space based capabilities and promoting its own industrial and academic science & technology base. The UK has many successful companies and university groups contributing to innovation and wealth creation, continually punching above its weight with industrial turnover running at almost ¬£12bn per year.
 
Space is the ultimate ‚Äòglobal commons‚Äô, and its use and exploitation is governed by UN treaty. But in recent years the problem of space pollution, including debris from accidental and deliberate satellite destruction, as well as concerns over hostile counter-space programmes (e.g. navigation jamming, communications interception), has become a cause of concern.
 
The lecture will address these and other issues in space security. It will consider ways in which a safe and secure space environment can be sustained and how we must work with partners and the wider community to promote codes of conduct. It will also explore opportunities for UK industry and academia in space security.

U8NNHmV3QPw,Spirit Science 12 ~ The Hidden Human History Movie,"Want to learn more? Check out the Book of Spirit, now available on the Spirit Shop! https://shop.spiritsciencecentral.com/

This video dives into and fully explores an alternate version of our own human history that connects a lot of dots that up until now, seemed as if random anomalies of the human race. 

The story is certainly different than anything you likely have heard or seen before, but just as well - paints a very complex and yet simple picture of our history, which explains all of the world‚Äôs religions, and the state of the world today. 

All of the struggles that humanity are experiencing, and even why we are struggling to begin with, is explained through this story.

Vp8UKU44A6c,Squishy Makeover: Fixing Your Squishies #12,"Hey guys! Here's the long awaited 12th episode of squishy makeovers. Just a good ole fashioned one, no gimmicks! I'm sorry I am late for posting this, it has really beeen a long process making this video. Also, I have been a tad sick (if you can't tell from the constant coughing lol). Enjoy!

Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!

_________FAQs__________

1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?
So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already 

2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?
No. Everyone gave me these squishies as donations to the series because they were no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be completely impossible for me financially to send back squishies. Just to RECEIVE these squishies costs me hundreds of dollars (I have to pay for P.O. box fees) There are MANY other reasons as well, I explained it in this video if you want to know the full list of reasons: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKYCV...

3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?
I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip and Scribbles. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.

4. IS PUFFY PAINT THE SAME AS FABRIC PAINT?
Yep!! Puffy paint is just a type of fabric paint.

5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?
The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.

6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?
I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off. 

7. WHAT MEMORY FOAM DO YOU USE?
I usually just buy a memory foam pillow on Amazon.com and use that to cut up.

8. CAN YOU DO MORE SQUISHIES IN EACH VIDEO OR DO MAKEOVER VIDEOS EVERY WEEK?
I wish I could! But these videos take me about 30-50 hours to film and edit (not including waiting for the paint to dry or any breaks). And usually about 8 or 9 days of working on it. So it‚Äôs not really possible to do these any more than I am already doing without lowering the quality. PLUS! I want to keep up with my Monday videos and my art and craft videos as well ‚ò∫

9. WHY DO YOU SOMETIMES USE A POPSICLE STICK AND OTHER TIMES USE A PAINTBRUSH TO APPLY PAINT?
The ‚Äúslick‚Äù fabric paint has a very thick consistency that does not spread easily with a paint brush. Using a popsicle stick is much easier for this type of paint. BUT the ""matte"" fabric paint is much thinner, similar consistency to acrylic paint and it can easily be applied with a paintbrush. When you mix the two, you can get away with a paintbrush as well :)

10. WHY DO YOU LIKE RAINBOW SO MUCH?
I just like color, and I think rainbows are pretty. There‚Äôs really no other reason for my obsession haha

xyAH5LGMQhs,Stabilized Insoluble Sulfur Manufacturing Business,"Stabilized Insoluble Sulfur Manufacturing Business. Production of Insoluble Sulphur Stabilizing Agent
Insoluble sulfur (IS) is a type of sulfur polymer, which is insoluble in CS2 and is a good rubber vulcanizing agent [1-4]. There are two types of IS, oil-filled and non-oil-filled. The production of IS usually adopts a high temperature method, which causes the liquid or gas sulfur to spray into cold liquids to obtain IS with a concentration of 30-60wt%. To obtain high concentrations of IS, solvent has been used to extract the soluble sulfur, followed by filling with oil to obtain oil-filled IS [2, 7-11].
Insoluble sulfur is an important rubber additive agent. It improves product quality, wearability and resistance to both fatigue and ageing. In addition to being universally recognized as the best vulcanizing agent, it is widely used in the manufacture of tire, rubber pipe, shoes, cable and wire insulating materials, latex, all kinds of automobile rubber parts and is also a necessary component of belt tires. Therefore, due to its non-blooming characteristic, insoluble sulfur is widely used in the manufacture of radial rubber and other synthetic rubber products, also in the light-colored rubber products in which common sulfur is incorporated in high proportion.

Art work via introduction: Justin Khuong of Nhong 

Videographer: Pierre Ogeron

This projects preparation began in December of 2011 by researching the standpoint theory.  This theory concerns the authority generated by people's knowledge and the power such authority has to shape people's opinions in daily life. Standpoint theory's most important concept is that an individual's own perspectives are shaped by his or her experiences in social locations and social groups.",Art and Music

taU3Rbyvsc4,STIAS Lecture Series 2018: Jian-Wei Pan ‚Äì From Einstein‚Äôs Curiosity to New Quantum Technologies,"Quantum information science and technology are emerging and fascinating technologies formed by combining coherent manipulating of individual quantum systems and information technology. This enables secure quantum cryptography (quantum communication), super-fast quantum computing, revealing the laws of complex physical systems (quantum simulation), and improving measurement precision (quantum metrology) to beat classical limits. This presentation will highlight some of our progress with quantum communication, quantum computing, quantum simulation and quantum metrology, based on photons and atoms.

Jian-Wei Pan is Director: Division of Quantum Physics and Quantum Information at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei and holds a PhD from the University of Vienna (1999).

v-toMaehfmQ,Strange Interactive Art Installation of Musical Instrument Inventions - Music Box Roving Village,"When the Music Box Roving Village  is installed in a new location they change and add new instruments so when you see it it won't look the same or have the same instruments as you see in this documentary -  This documentary exhibits strange musical instruments invented by the New Orleans Airlift collaboration.  It's an amazing installation a village of portable sculpture dwellings that double as musical instruments.  The walls literally make music. Musicians famous and not so famous perform concerts and then the public is invited to jam on the creations. Any one young and old can play! Airlift programming highlights our city's underground art and under-the-radar artists, transporting the dynamic street culture, living folk culture and growing contemporary arts scene of New Orleans to far-flung locations around the world for exhibitions, workshops, festivals, performances, and collaborative projects.

Airlift also brings influential artists from abroad to participate in collaborative endeavors with local artists in our own community. We believe that collaboration between artists and across communities shares resources, empowers learning and unites disparate groups in common and powerful goals.
New Orleans Airlift is an artist-driven initiative that collaborates and creates alongside the artists and communities we support.

Airlift was founded in 2008 by musician and artist manager Jay Pennington and Delaney Martin, a multi-media installation artist, as a response to the unparalleled destruction of Hurricane Katrina and its devastating aftermath which left local artists, like all New Orleanians, struggling for their lives and livelihoods.

Jay and Delaney recognized a need for new audiences who could support these artists as they rebuilt their city. They dreamt up a one-time project that took city artists to Berlin and called it The New Orleans Airlift after the Berlin Airlift of WWII. Other exchange projects that used an import/export model and a multidisciplinary approach soon followed and the name stuck.

New Orleans is the last great bastion of living folk culture in the United states. Airlift projects honor tradition alongside innovation, leading our artists, culture and communities in meaningful new directions.

 Special Head Levitation
He is  best known for his appearances on America‚Äôs Got Talent in 2013 /2014 and subsequent viral videos of his Levitation acts. His America's Got talent performances were viewed by more than 40 million people on YouTube alone!

""The popularity amongst Children across America following my viral appearances really inspired me, That I've been given an opportunity to be a good roll model for kids. Thats a great reason to wake up in morning"" -Wolverton
""My artistic Vision is greatly influenced by my upbringing in the Native American Peyote Way Church and the Baha'i Faith. I realized that  1,000 years ago all art, performance, music, and dance was done through spiritual inspiration. The original performances were ritual and Ceremony. It wasn't until the Renaissance  that making a living through art became more widespread. Through my performances I intend to bring us back to an age of mysticism. Reminding people that performance is a ritual and that magic can be spiritual. 

The Special Head show goes beyond a traditional magic show. Not only does Wolverton perform Music while simultaneously performing magic illusions, Wolverton also incorporates thought provoking theatrics into his many acts. Danny uses illusions to cause the viewer to question ""what it means to be human."" His show is flexible and can be adapted to entertain many different age groups.

The Anarchestra is set up as an interactive art installation that the public gets to play. It can be tuned all to the same key making it hard to hit the wrong notes. You don't have to be a good musician to play it.

Bangladesh is a true street food heaven. We didn't know when we flew in, but there is a LOT of delicious street food to eat in Bangladesh. In Old Dhaka, AKA Puran Dhaka, you can  spend a lifetime trying new street foods around every corner. And what I loved so much from eating street food around Old Dhaka was not only the delicious mustardy flavour of the street food here, but the friendliness of the Bangladeshi people. 

Everywhere we went to eat street food in Bangladesh, the peoople welcomed us with open hearts and a big smile. It left a huge impression on us and left us inspired to come back to eat more street food in Bangladesh again. 

The Bengali food you will taste when you travel in Bangladesh is incredibly delicious. After tasting my first bharta in Old Dhaka, I was convinced that this is some of the best street food around the world. There truly is no other flavour like the food in Bangladesh! You have to come here to try it yourself!

To start out our HUGE Bangladesh Street Food Tour, we visited Puran dhaka AKA Old dhaka bright and early to eat some famous Dhakan Bhakor Khani, also known as the Dhakan biscuit. It's a wheat dough and semolina flour biscuit that has 2 versions, one sweet and one plain. The sweet version has dough and semolina soaked in molasses and saffron. The dough is pushed DEEP inside the tandoor oven, the same ovens used to cook famous Bangladeshi recipes all over the country. It goes PERFECTLY with some delicious Bangladeshi street chai! There are many Bakorkhani stalls in Puran Daka (Old Dhaka), but we visited the most famous one, Nashu Faruker Shera Bakorkhani.

After that amazing Bangladeshi street food biscuit, we went for the ULTIMATE meal of Bangladeshi cuisine, the bhorta feast! We're taking you to Nirob Hotel for some AMAZING Bhortas! When you first come to Bangladesh, everyone tells you to eat the Bhortas, and you may not be sure what they are. Bhortas are a special Bengali cuisine usually made of mashed fish or mashed vegetables with mustard oil, chili, garlic, onion, and the occasional sprinkle of lime. The bhortas are all brought to your table and you pay for what you eat, and leave what you don't touch. I ate a SPICY duck curry that was out of this world! 

After the amazing Bengali curry heaven, we made our way to the most FAMOUS street food in Old Dhaka, the haji biryani. Highly seasoned rice is cooked in mustard oil and filled with extremely tender goat meat and topped with lime! SUPER TASTY!

After this, we're bringing you to a solid street dessert in Old Dhaka, Bangladesh, the lassi and faluda, found at beauty lassi, one of the tastiest lassis in the whole country! I personally loved the faluda and found it to be one of my favourite desserts I've ever had!

After the lassi, we're taking you to try a famous Bangladeshi street food, the Pitha rice flour pancake loaded with spicy mustard bhorta. You can find these all over the streets of Old Dhaka and you should definitely try one!

After this, we're finishing off the night by going for the famous Murgh pulao found at nanna biryani. The best part of this dish was the sweet and rich onion gravy that covered the super tender chicken and pulao rice!

If you're thinking of traveling to Bangladesh to eat street food in Bangladesh, DO IT! The food is amazing, the people are friendly, and you will have a great time! I know we will be back for sure!

Jay (Mukase Chic) is an amazing woman, so positive and talented, and so much fun to hang out with and eat with! She‚Äôs a food personality, a chef, a restauranteur, a blogger - she‚Äôs incredible. Check out her Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/mukasechic/) and YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8y8uGewOe2NAuNQALV_uaw). 

Anyway, so Jay took me an ultimate street food tour in Accra, here‚Äôs all the amazing food we ate:

Red red (bean stew) and plantain - This was the first stop, a small stall that Jay has been eating at for years. They fry plantain, and then serve the plantain along with beans stewed in palm nut oil, and combine it with gari, which are cassava flakes. The result, is a filling and very satisfying combination of sweet and tangy plantains with salty oily beans. What‚Äôs key as Jay explained to me is the palm nut oil, which provides so much oil and fragrance. It was delicious, and a perfect way to begin this Ghanaian street food tour in Accra!
Total price - 4 GHC ($0.90)

Nima Market - Next we caught a taxi to Nima Market, known for its spices. We tried everything we could find, which was quite a lot of snacks here and there. The market was fantastic to walk around, full of action and energy.
Coconut toffee
Tigernuts - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Masa - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Zowey (adaakwa) - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Kulikuli - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Boiled egg - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Fried cheese - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Burkina - 3 GHC ($0.70)
Bofrot - 1 GHC ($0.20)

Peace Chop Bar (Chop Bar - Local Ghanaian restaurant) - Finally, to end this street food tour of Ghana in Accra, we stopped back at the chop bar that we had visited earlier in the morning. Seeing the cooking was sensational, it only made me hungrier for lunch. By the time we arrived back, they had already sold out of a few dishes, but there was still plenty enough to choose from. I tried the banku with goat meat, and it was fantastic.
Total price - 36 GHC ($7.90)

This was an incredible day of eating street food in Accra. Many thanks to Jay!

KARACHI, Sindh, Pakistan

From the mountains on Hunza Valley, we flew to Karachi, on the Arabian sea, and a world of difference from the mountains. I was happy to be in Karachi to discover the amazing street food, and it didn‚Äôt let us down!

Here are the things we ate on this ultimate Pakistani street food tour of Karachi, Pakistan:

Javed Nihari - I‚Äôve probably said this a few times, but there‚Äôs no meatier breakfast (maybe in the world) than nihari, a meat stew that‚Äôs often paired with plenty of desi ghee and either brains of bone-marrow. It‚Äôs truly a breakfast of meat loving champions, but it is filling and heavy, and so good. Javed Nihari is one of the best places in Karachi to eat nihari.
Total price - 1,150 PKR ($8.42)

Burns Road - We continued on to Burns Road, one of the legendary street food streets in Karachi. It was a Sunday morning and there were elections happening, so Burns road wasn‚Äôt actually that busy. But we did find a few delicious things to try.

Arabian paratha - The Arabian paratha, or mataba, or any other names it has across Asia is a stuffed roti. In this case he filled it with chicken and spices and egg before wrapping it up and shallow frying it. It was delicious.
Price - 120 PKR ($0.88)

Matka kulfi - Also on Burns Road is a maka kulfi shop where they sell Pakistani ice cream in little clay cups. The pistachio and saffron were the best.
Price - 50 PKR ($0.37) each

Rabri - I‚Äôm not huge on sweets, but on Burns Road we need to try rabri.
Price - 200 PKR ($0.88)

Chicken biryani - Just randomly walking around we decided to try our first plate of Karachi biryani - and Karachi is known for their biryani. It was simple, but very good, with a wonderful flavor of dried lime, and it was just a very cool spot.
Price - 80 PRK ($0.59)

Liaquatabad - We continued this Pakistani street food tour of Karachi in Liaquatabad a busy market area, full of street food.

Qadri Nalli Biryani - This was the highlight of the food tour, if not one of the best dishes of my entire trip to Pakistan. Nalli biryani, Pakistani bone marrow biryani is one of the best things ever.
Price - They wouldn‚Äôt charge us

Salad - His ninja chopping skills brought me in and there was no way I couldn‚Äôt stop to eat his salad. Amazing!
Price - 40 PKR ($0.28)

MashAllah Fish Katakat - The next meal we had was MashAllah Fish Katakat, and a dish called katakat. Most of the time its prepared with organs, but this was with fish, and it was again one of the best dishes I ate in Pakistan. An amazing combination of fish, spices, and chutney.

Landhi Dairy Colony - Next we headed to the biggest buffalo colony in Asia, maybe the world. Over 700,000 - 800,000 cattle and livestock live within this area that is within Karachi, Pakistan. It was fascinating to visit and drink the freshest buffalo milk possible.

Dua Restaurant - Finally for dinner we finished this Karachi street food tour at Dua Restaurant, a huge restaurant serving grilled meat and karahis. The prawns karahi was the highlight for me.
Total price - 4,840 PKR ($35.45)

It was an amazing day of street food in Karachi, Pakistan!

Huge thank you to Fadhlur for reaching out and taking us on a Malaysian street food tour of Kuala Lumpur. It was an amazing day, and I have so much love to Malaysia as it was one of the first countries where I started making street food videos - as you‚Äôll see in the video!

Ok, here are all the street food stalls and restaurants we ate at on this tour:

Mansion Tea Stall
The thing to order here is the roti canai special, roti that chopped up, then doused in a variety of curry sauces, sambal, and a few soft boiled eggs. It‚Äôs a perfect way to begin your day in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 2.80 RM ($0.68) per plate

Nasi Lemak Tanglin
Nasi lemak is often considered the national food of Malaysia, and there are plenty of places to eat it throughout Kuala Lumpur. Having been around since 1948, Nasi Lemak Tanglin is a place I had wanted to go for a while. It was overall very good, with a nice laid back atmosphere and surrounded by nature. Nasi lemak - about 8 RM ($1.94) per plate

Ikan Bakar Seri Melaka (Jalan Bellamy)
One of my favorite places to eat ikan bakar, grilled fish, is on Jalan Bellamy. Back in 2012, I had to hike over a highway and climb a few fences to get there as I was only on foot. In this video, I‚Äôm a bit older, and we had a car! The ikan bakar was just as good as I remember it. Total price - 68 RM ($16.51) for everything

Sri Ganapathi Mess
One of the best things about Malaysian food is its incredible diversity, including Malay, Chinese, and Indian food. Banana leaf south Indian food is very popular and I was recommended to try Sri Ganapathi Mess, a restaurant tucked away into a home. An amazing south Indian food experience in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 59 RM ($14.32) for 4 people

Kedai Kopi Lai Foong
Finally, another dish that many had recommended me was the unique clam noodles in Kuala Lumpur Chinatown at the legendary Kedai Kopi Lai Foong. It was delicious, and a perfect way to end an amazing Malaysian street food tour in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 10 RM ($2.43) per bowl

Also, just published a full Pakistan travel guide: https://goo.gl/5MHgz4

I‚Äôm very excited to share this first full street food in Pakistan video with you! We started our trip in Lahore, a vibrant, colorful, and packed full of food city. Our first day in Lahore turned out to be a 16 hour street food marathon in Lahore, and it was an amazing day!

Get more details on my Pakistan Travel Guide: https://goo.gl/5MHgz4

Sadiq Halwa Puri (https://goo.gl/maps/Yoy9dJ6steF2) - We began the day with a very common breakfast throughout Pakistan, halwa puri, but along with chana curry (chickpea curry). We ate off the car, enjoying every bit of the freshly fried puris and curry.
Total price - 640 PKR ($4.78)

Chacha Feeka Lassi (https://goo.gl/maps/RGQBRQaNj8p) - Next we drove over to Gawalmandi, one of the most legendary areas in Lahore for food. We headed straight to a breakfast staple, the lassi shop and had the most creamy heavy milkshake I‚Äôve ever had, called a pera lassi.

Roasted chickpeas - 25 PKR ($0.19) - After exiting an alley, right in front of us was a man selling chickpeas and corn roasted in black Himalayan salt. It‚Äôs a very common street food snack in Pakistan.

Sweet potato - 80 PKR ($0.60) - Sweet potato is also a very common street food snack in Lahore, seasoned with masala and a type of citrus juice.

Baba Kulfi Wala - Next we headed over to Shah Alami Market, another huge and bustling market in Lahore.

Kulfi - 20 PKR ($0.15) each - One of the most famous places to eat ice cream in Lahore is Baba Kulfi Wala, and you‚Äôll find a crowd of people standing around the corner of the road eating sticks of their famous kulfi.

Orange juice - 50 PKR ($0.37)

Chana chaat - 120 PKR ($0.89) per plate - One of my personal favorite Pakistani street food snacks of the day was chana chaat, a chickpea snack. He added in all sorts of spices, chutneys, and seasonings, to create a deliciously refreshing snack.

Butt Karahi Tikka Restaurant - Easily one of the most well known restaurants in Lahore is Butt Karahi, specializing in curry made in a rounded pan, called a karahi (we will be eating a lot of karahi‚Äôs in Pakistan!). We ordered both a mutton karahi and chicken karahi. Both were amazing, filled with spices and butter, but the tenderness of the mutton was the winner.
Total price - 5,600 PKR ($41.84)

Siddique Fish Corner - You‚Äôll notice that Lahore seems to come alive at night, and street food is everywhere at night. We began the evening with Siddique Fish Corner, one of the best fried fish stalls in Lahore. It was awesome, and so busy.
Total price - 400 PKR ($2.99)

Khalifa Balochi Sajji - Another Pakistani dish I wanted to try was chicken sajji, a type of hand rotisserie chicken. The atmosphere and cooking method was incredible.
Total price - 390 PKR ($2.91)

Khan Baba Restaurant - Finally for our last dinner on this 16 hour day of food in Pakistan, we went to one of Ali‚Äôs favorite restaurants in Lahore, Khan Baba. The goat chops were impressive as was the korma curry.

Again, massive thank you to Ali, from Pakistan Travel Mart for hosting us in Pakistan, taking us around, and organizing everything.

KELANTAN, MALAYSIA - If you‚Äôre looking for amazing Malaysian food, Kelantan is a state that‚Äôs unique, cultural, and has some of the best food in Malaysia.

During trips to Kuala Lumpur over the years, I had tried a number of Kelantanese dishes, but that only increased my desire to eventually visit the source, to visit Kelantan, Malaysia. Finally, this was our chance, and we went on a Malaysian food tour of Kelantan, around Kota Bharu.

Here‚Äôs all the amazing food we ate in this video:

Nasi Kerabu Panji - Without a doubt, one of the Malaysian foods you don‚Äôt want to miss when you visit Kelantan is nasi kerabu, rice salad, but it‚Äôs so much more than that. It‚Äôs a breakfast dish and we first started at Nasi Kerabu Panji, a local favorite spot. You get blue rice, topped with salad and side dishes, drizzled in budu fermented fish sauce, and topped with you choice of main mean. It was extraordinary.
Price - About 8 MYR ($1.96) per plate

Jijah's Nasi Kerabu - Since nasi kerabu is one of the top Malaysian foods of the state of Kelantan, we decided to have two nasi kerabu‚Äôs back to back, but totally different styles and even different colors of rice. Jijah's Nasi Kerabu specializes in grilled goat, and it was incredible, highly recommended when you visit Kelantan, Malaysia.
Price - 4.50 MYR ($1.10) per plate

Siti Khadijah Market - One of the top attractions in Kota Bharu is Siti Khadijah Market, a beautiful colorful market where you can buy all the ingredients from Kelantan and there‚Äôs also an amazing cooked food section. Laksam - 3.50 MYR ($0.86) per bowl - I had a bowl of laksam, a Kelantan Malaysian food version of laksa. Akok - 1 MYR ($0.24) for 2 - Later we also tried akok, a popular and local Kelantanese dessert.

D'Umi Nasi Ulam - Another Malaysian food you don‚Äôt want to miss eating in Kelantan is nasi ulam, rice with raw vegetables, and a mix of dishes, all eaten specifically with budu - fermented anchovy sauce. This restaurant was amazing, a huge mix of dishes, friendly owner, and delicious food. Of course, we couldn‚Äôt resist the tempoyak - fermented durian paste.

Kak Jah Ayam Percik Bulatan Lemal - Finally to end this Malaysian street food tour of Kelantan, we had some ayam percik, a coconut milk barbecue sauce dish that originates in Kelantan. We barely arrived in time, but luckily got the last few skewers.
Ayam percik - 16 MYR ($3.93) per big skewer

Kelantan is an amazing state in Malaysia to eat Malaysian street food and I thoroughly enjoyed my visit, the incredible food, and friendly people.

Thank you for watching this Malaysian food video in Kelantan. If you haven‚Äôt already, you can watch the entire series here: https://youtu.be/u5LYl4DM5c4

40voeYiLYdY,Suzanne Berger: Vannevar Bush Lecture Series on Science and Technology Innovation,"This is part of a lecture series during spring 2018

This lecture series, which includes imminent researchers and innovators from a wide variety of fields across MIT, will showcase the numerous forms that innovation takes and the pathways it can take from ideation to implementation. 

Summary
My talk will focus on two MIT initiatives on production and innovation: Made in America: Regaining the Productive Edge (1989) and Making in America:  From Innovation to Market (2013). Over the thirty years that separate the two projects, globalization, the rise of new rival economies, and transformative technological changes have created huge new opportunities and painful challenges of adjustment for society.  On each of the two projects researchers fanned out into companies across the United States and to Japan, China, Germany, and France to try to understand from the bottom up how innovation moves into production and into the market; how and where new good jobs are created; how and where new industries come to life.    Even after thirty years of profound technological, political, and social change, some of the problems we identified in the first study still remain basically unresolved‚Äîhow, for example, to educate people for a lifetime of changes in the workplace; how to move innovation from the lab into society more rapidly. At MIT where we have a track record of carrying out research that brings together faculty and students from departments across the Institute to study complex problems that spill over disciplinary boundaries, we have the resources to make headway on these big questions.

About the Speaker
Suzanne Berger is Raphael Dorman-Helen Starbuck Professor of Political Science. Her current research focuses on politics and globalization. She recently co-chaired the MIT Production in the Innovation Economy project, and in September 2013 published Making in America: From Innovation to Market. She created the MIT International Science and Technology Initiative, and participated in the 1989 Made in America project at MIT. She wrote Made By Hong Kong and Global Taiwan (with Richard K. Lester). She is the author of Notre Premi√®re Mondialisation and How We Compete. Her earlier work focused on political development (Peasants Against Politics) and the organization of interests (Dualism and Discontinuity in Industrial Societies and Organizing Interests in Western Europe.)Suzanne Berger served as Head of the MIT Department of Political Science, founding chair of the SSRC Committee on West Europe, and Vice President of the American Political Science Association. She has been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The French government has awarded her the Palmes Academiques, Chevalier de l'Ordre National du Merite and the L√©gion d'Honneur.",Science and Technology

We had one full day in Zurich, Switzerland, and I wanted to make the most of it by going on a Swiss food tour, eating as much food as possible, and walking around and seeing some of the most famou sights and attractions in the beautiful city of Zurich.

Here are all the details about everything you‚Äôll find in this video:

Z√ºrich, Switzerland

Caf√© Henrici - To begin the day for Swiss breakfast, we stopped to have a cup of coffee, and also I wanted a croissant, but they were all out of the morning already, so I settled for a few small slices of bread. It was excellent.
Total price for 3 people - 24.40 CHF ($25.75)

Lindenhof Hill - This is a great place to get a view over Old Zurich, and it puts the city into perspective and helps you get your bearings, and the views are beautiful.

Swiss Chuchi - Thank you to Marcel for this recommendation. In Switzerland for a single day, I needed to eat one of the most well known of all Swiss food, cheese fondue. At Swiss Chuchi restaurant, we enjoyed both cheese fondue and raclette, both of which were excellent and the most cheese I‚Äôve had in a  single meal in a very long time.
Total price - 126 CHF ($132.98)
That included all I ate, and 2 other plates  of food.

Grossm√ºnster - This church is one of the most recognizable landmarks of Zurich. For a small fee, you can pay to climb to the top of the tower for an amazing view.
Price -  4 CHF ($4.22)

Lake Zurich - The city of Zurich is surrounds Lake Zurich, which is unbelievably clean and pure.

Kronenhalle Restaurant  - This is one of the most legendary and classic restaurants in all of Zurich, Switzerland. I didn‚Äôt realized it was so expensive and so high end, but we decided to go for it anyway, because I was looking forward to trying their Z√ºrcher Geschnetzeltes, the most well known of all Zurich Swiss food dishes consisting of thin sliced potato paired with veal stew. It‚Äôs quite a stunning dish and the version at Kronenhalle Restaurant was absolutely stunning.
Total price - 126 CHF ($132.98)

Bahnhofstrasse Shopping street 

Rheinfelder Bierhalle - To finish off this ultimate Swiss food tour of Zurich in a single day we went to Rheinfelder Bierhalle, a beer hall and restaurant in Zurich. I ordered their specialty, Jumbo Jumbo Cordon Bleu. Cordon bleu is another one of the Swiss food dishes you don‚Äôt want  to miss when you‚Äôre in Zurich.

Thank you very much for watching this  Swiss food tour!

Sc0Kr9JEVXs,Tanu Weds Manu,"London-based Dr. Manoj Sharma returns home to Delhi, and in the company of his parents, Kishan and Anju, as well as several others, travels to Chaman Ganj, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh to meet his prospective bride, Tanuja Trivedi. He approves of her, informs his elders and they begin preparations for the marriage. Subsequently he gets a rude awakening when Tanuja tells him that she already has a boyfriend and plans to marry him even against her parents' wishes. Manoj informs his parents, and they set about to see other girls for their son - albeit in vain - as he has his heart set on Tanuja, and is all set to return back unmarried. Manoj and Tanuja are fated to meet again in Kapurthala, Punjab, while attending the marriage of Jaspreet Singh Jassi and Payal Sinha. While Manoj hopes to win Tanuja's heart - he will face more rejection when she enlists his assistance to elope with another male. (CBFC UA CIL/2/16/2011)",Manufacturing

go_QOzc79Uc,Teach every child about food | Jamie Oliver,"http://www.ted.com Sharing powerful stories from his anti-obesity project in Huntington, W. Va., TED Prize winner Jamie Oliver makes the case for an all-out assault on our ignorance of food.

Jamie Oliver is transforming the way we feed ourselves, and our children. Jamie Oliver has been drawn to the kitchen since he was a child working in his father's pub-restaurant. He showed not only a precocious culinary talent but also a passion for creating (and talking about) fresh, honest, delicious food. In the past decade, the shaggy-haired ""Naked Chef"" of late-'90s BBC2 has built a worldwide media conglomerate of TV shows, books, cookware and magazines, all based on a formula of simple, unpretentious food that invites everyone to get busy in the kitchen. And as much as his cooking is generous, so is his business model -- his Fifteen Foundation, for instance, trains young chefs from challenged backgrounds to run four of his restaurants.

Now, Oliver is using his fame and charm to bring attention to the changes that Brits and Americans need to make in their lifestyles and diet. Campaigns such as Jamie's School Dinner, Ministry of Food and Food Revolution USA combine Olivers culinary tools, cookbooks and television, with serious activism and community organizing -- to create change on both the individual and governmental level.

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",History

Sweden. The current largest, most populous and richest of the Nordic nations, has a long and turbulent history.

Join us as we uncover the history of Swedish vikings who raided and plundered across eastern Europe, but who also traded, ruled and settled the eastern and southern lands in great numbers. 

Find out how the Viking earldoms united to form the Swedish kingdom and become ruled by Danish Kings, only to break away to form their own fledgling empire.

Dfl4ZaiucpQ,The Anunnaki Creation Story: The Biggest Secret in Human History - Nibiru is Coming,"445 000 years ago, ‚Äúcreator gods‚Äù ‚Äì as they call it ‚Äì came to Earth. They were called the Anunnaki, which means ‚ÄúThose Who from Heaven to Earth Came‚Äù.  These beings inhabited a distant orbiting planet called Nibiru, which only entered our solar system every 3,600 years.  They describe Nibiru as many times the diameter of Earth, and abundant with iron oxide, making its rivers and lakes appear red. A side note about Nibiru:  according to the Sumerian tablets, Nibiru‚Äôs atmosphere began to deteriorate and became a hostile place for life, and in order to restore it, the Annunaki needed one important element for their atmosphere:  gold.

SzTaU5YI3oo,The Art of Improvisation: Inspiration and Meaning for Music,"""How many people have skinned their knees when they were playing as a kid?"" It's a question that Christopher Azzara, Professor of Music Education at the Eastman School of Music, likes to ask his students. ""If you didn't skin your knee, you weren't playing hard enough.""

It's a notion that puts in perspective his approach to teaching music, particularly teaching students how to improvise when it's outside their comfort zone. The message is, it's okay to make mistakes. From Azzara's perspective, it's the mistakes that sometimes allow students to learn the most.

Azzara has been teaching undergraduate and graduate students at Eastman these skills for years, drawing from his own background as a jazz musician where improvisation is at the core of the art form. Many of his students come from a classical background, and while their musical abilities are well defined, they may not have had many opportunities to improvise. Azzara's passion and easy-going manner allow them the freedom to explore what can be foreign territory for some of his students without fear of failure.

When Howard Potter, director of the Eastman Community Music School, approached Azzara about teaching a series of public workshops on improvisation, it seemed like a perfect fit. The approach for these workshops is the same as with the Eastman students, but the range of ages, abilities, background and instruments is much wider.

Some of the people that show up to the free workshops are in elementary school, some are years into their retirement, and there is everything in between. Some show up with a violin and years of lessons, others come with a banjo that was picked up as a hobby. For Azzara, the variety of people that attend these workshops is part of the beauty. That diversity can only enhance the learning experience from his viewpoint.

N0u04EqNVjo,The Art of Punk - Black Flag - Art + Music - MOCAtv,"On the first episode of ""The Art of Punk"" we dissect the art of the legendary Black Flag. From the iconic four bars symbols, to the many coveted and collected gig flyers, singles, and band t-shirts, all depicting the distinctive Indian ink drawn image and text by artist Raymond Pettibon. We start off in Los Angeles talking to two founding members singer Keith Morris, and bass player Chuck Dukowski, about what the scene was like in 1976 - setting the stage for the band's formation, as well as the bands name, and the creation of the iconic four bars symbol. Raymond Pettibon talks with us from his New York art studio. Back in LA we meet with Flea, from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, about how the art, the music, and that early LA scene impacted his own life and career. To wrap it all up we sit and talk at length, with Henry Rollins, at MOCA Grand Ave in Los Angeles, about all of the above and more. 


Created, directed, and Executive Produced by writer/author of 'Fucked Up + Photocopied', Bryan Ray Turcotte (Kill Your Idols), and Bo Bushnell (The Western Empire), The Art Of Punk traces the roots of the punk movement and the artists behind the iconic logos of punk bands such as: Black Flag (Raymond Pettibon), The Dead Kennedys (Winston Smith), and Crass (Dave King).

In addition to profiling the artists, the series includes intimate interviews with former band members, notable artists, and celebrities who have been heavily influenced by the art of punk rock including Jello Biafra, Tim Biskup, Scott Campbell, Chuck Dukowski, Flea, Steve Olson, Penny Rimbaud, Henry Rollins, Owen Thornton, and Gee Vaucher.

The filmmakers Bryan Ray Turcotte and Bo Bushnell take a unique approach to exploring the rich histories of these three seminal punk legends by focusing on the influential imagery and seeking out stories that have not been told yet through the artwork, which is integral to the importance and influence of each band.

On June 11, 2013 The Art Of Punk debuts on MOCAtv with an episode on Raymond Pettibon and the artwork of Black Flag. The stories behind the art of the Dead Kennedys will debut on June 18, and June 25 will see the release of the Crass episode, all of which will be available at: www.youtube.com/MOCAtv

Edward Saunders, freelance lecturer

LECTURE TITLES

1.  The city emerges
2.  Emperor Charles IV and the golden age of Bohemia
3.  Jan Hus, Emperor Rudolf II and Saint John of Nepomuk
4.  Baroque splendour and extravagance
5.  Alphonse Mucha and Czech Art Nouveau

Prague is one of the most beautiful cities of Europe and, uniquely, has remained largely unscathed by war for over three hundred years. Its fame rests upon a magnificent range of Baroque churches, palaces and public buildings embellished with art and sculpture from the eighteenth century. However, often overlooked, Prague also houses extraordinary examples of cultural works from a variety of other centuries, in particular the medieval period of the early fourteenth century and, at the other end of the time spectrum, the Art Nouveau movement.

The lectures will highlight major developments in Prague‚Äôs history from its origins in the ninth century up to today, while considering representative examples of works from successive artistic periods. Throughout the lectures, relevant excerpts of Prague‚Äôs musical tradition ‚Äì from religious chants and Hussite hymns to the compositions of the two towering figures of twentieth century Czech music, Smetana and Dvorak ‚Äì will be introduced.

dnV_MTFEGIY,The Atlantic Slave Trade: Crash Course World History #24,"In which John Green teaches you about one of the least funny subjects in history: slavery. John investigates when and where slavery originated, how it changed over the centuries, and how Europeans and colonists in the Americas arrived at the idea that people could own other people based on skin color. 

Slavery has existed as long as humans have had civilization, but the Atlantic Slave Trade was the height, or depth, of dehumanizing, brutal, chattel slavery. American slavery ended less than 150 years ago. In some parts of the world, it is still going on. So how do we reconcile that with modern life? In a desperate attempt at comic relief, Boba Fett makes an appearance.

These foods may taste completely different, but all of these phenomena come from microorganisms chowing down on sugar and belching up some culinary byproducts.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (27 January 1756 ‚Äì 5 December 1791) was a prolific and influential composer of the classical era.
Born in Salzburg, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court, but grew restless and traveled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35. The circumstances of his early death have been much mythologized.

He composed more than 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote: ""posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years"".

8. 13 Colonies

7. Washington Cherry Tree

6. The Crossing of the Delaware

5. Van Gogh Cut off Ear
While in school, learning about famous artists, we all know that Van Gogh was simply a mad man who sliced off his ear and mailed it to his lover, right? Who would really inflict that much physical pain on themselves over an ex? After looking through quite a few letters and it seems more than likely that him and a friend of his got into a scuffle involving too much French wine and a sword. Which normally don‚Äôt mix too well. Van Gogh was certainly no snitch and didn‚Äôt want to report the incident that could potentially put his best friend in prison. 

4. Sphinx Nose
How did the Sphinx lose it‚Äôs nose? Did it get a bad Rhinoplasty?  Or was While Napoleon was invading Egypt, he used the nose as a target practice for his cannons. This is another absurd historical legend that many still might believe. The nose was gone centuries before Napoleon was even born. Napoleon was fascinated with Egyptology and sought to preserve egypt‚Äôs antiquities. The limestone used to construct the sphinx eroded fairly quickly after a few thousand years had gone by. But Egypt is a Muslim country where worshipping idols is not permitted and it‚Äôs still a wonder how this monument is still here. Historical accounts from the 1400‚Äôs say that a religious islamist leader, Muhammad Sa‚Äôim al Dahr, destroyed the nose when he saw people worshipping the sphinx as an idol. 

3. Vikings Horned Helmets
Archaeologists have a better chance of finding a unicorn than finding a horned viking helmet. Even the football team the Vikings, have horns on their helmet. This is just a modern day myth and an artist's portrayal of how the vikings actually looks while in battle. Thiss portrayal began in the 1800‚Äôs when scandinavians artists such as Malmstrom and Mary McGregor included this style of helmet, like we see in this illustration of Leif Ericsson discovering Vineland. Horned helmets did exist but these were over a couple thousand of years ago during the bronze age and used for ritualistic religious ceremonies

2. Stonehenge
One of the biggest ancient mysteries in the world is certainly stonehenge and they‚Äôve been standing in that formation for 5000 years. Oh no don‚Äôt tell me this is a lie too. Could this all be some kind of cruel hoax? Historical records of the monument date back to about 1200 AD but it‚Äôs highly doubtful that they‚Äôve been in the same position we see them today.  A curator from Cambridge University quoted,‚ÄùNearly all the stones we see today have been moved in some way and are standing in concrete.‚Äù This image we see here shows stonehenge in 1877 with stones leaning on eachother. Many monuments around the world must be restored at some point. This photo here shows some type of restoration project going on in 1898 with two men on top of a block that looks like it‚Äôs being placed there with a crane.  This photo shows the crane picking up the block and you can clearly tell this is a massive restoration project. Take a look at the photos and let us know what you believe. 

1. First Thanksgiving
Sorry Guys, American eye has to ruin thanksgiving for you too. And there‚Äôs absolutely no truth to this one besides the feast itself and what we celebrate couldn‚Äôt be anything further from the truth! As a kid you might have believed your teacher saying that thanksgiving was a friendly celebration between Indians and Pilgrims who came together and feasted on Turkey legs and corn, sharing farming secrets. Thanksgiving was basically a celebration after a vengeful retaliation on native americans and it was celebrated around the same time each year. We won‚Äôt get into all the details but if you know how history tended to go between European settlers and Native Americans, you can probably take a good guess.

rY9zHNOjGrs,"The Civil War, Part I: Crash Course US History #20","In which John Green ACTUALLY teaches about the Civil War. In part one of our two part look at the US Civil War, John looks into the causes of the war, and the motivations of the individuals who went to war. The overarching causes and the individual motivations were not always the same, you see. John also looks into why the North won, and whether that outcome was inevitable. The North's industrial and population advantages are examined, as are the problems of the Confederacy, including its need to build a nation at the same time it was fighting a war. As usual, John doesn't get much into the actual battle by battle breakdown. He does talk a little about the overarching strategy that won the war, and Grant's plan to just overwhelm the South with numbers. Grant took a lot of losses in the latter days of the war, but in the end, it did lead to the surrender of the South. If you want to learn more about the Civil War, we recommend these books:

In which John Green teaches you about the Cold War as it unfolded in Asia. As John pointed out last week, the Cold War was occasionally hot, and a lot of that heat was generated in Asia. This is starting to sound weird with the hot/cold thing, so let's just say that the United States struggle against communist expansion escalated to full-blown, boots on the ground war in Korea and Vietnam. In both of these cases, the United States sent soldiers to intervene in civil wars that it looked like communists might win. That's a bit of a simplification, but John will explain it all to you.

John does this by exploring the totally awesome history book ""The Columbian Exchange"" by Alfred Cosby, Jr. After Columbus ""discovered"" the Americas, European conquerors, traders, and settlers brought all manner of changes to the formerly isolated continents. Disease and invasive plant and animal species remade the New World, usually in negative ways. While native people, plants, and animals were being displaced in the Americas, the rest of the world was benefitting from American imports, especially foods like maize, tomatoes, potatoes, pineapple, blueberries, sweet potatoes, and manioc. Was the Columbian Exchange a net positive? It's debatable. So debate.

Ot-acn1whrc,The Coming War On China (John Pilger) | History Documentary | Reel Truth History,"The Coming War on China, from award winning journalist John Pilger, reveals what the news doesn‚Äôt ‚Äì that the world‚Äôs greatest military power, the United States, and the world‚Äôs second economic power, China, both nuclear-armed, may well be on the road to war. 

Nuclear war is not only imaginable, but planned. The greatest build-up of NATO military forces since the Second World War is under way on the western borders of Russia. On the other side of the world, the rise of China is viewed in Washington as a threat to American dominance. 

To counter this, President Obama announced a ‚Äòpivot to Asia‚Äô, which meant that almost two-thirds of all US naval forces would be transferred to Asia and the Pacific, their weapons aimed at China. A policy which has been taken up by his successor Donald Trump, who during his election campaign said ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt continue to allow China to rape our country and that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing‚Äù.

Filmed on five possible front-lines across Asia and the Pacific over two years, the story is told in chapters that connect a secret and ‚Äòforgotten‚Äô past to the rapacious actions of great power today and to a resistance, of which little is known in the West.

The epidemics of obesity and diabetes are continuing to spread across the western world. Now we know why. Modern science has revealed our mistake.

The unnecessary fear of natural food has inadvertently caused us to eat more of the new food that can make us hungrier, make us eat more, make us fat.

Ever more people are realizing the mistake and seeing the solution. The food revolution is here. Please help spread the word once you know.

lTTvKwCylFY,The French Revolution: Crash Course World History #29,"In which John Green examines the French Revolution, and gets into how and why it differed from the American Revolution. Was it the serial authoritarian regimes? The guillotine? The Reign of Terror? All of this and more contributed to the French Revolution not being quite as revolutionary as it could have been. France endured multiple constitutions, the heads of heads of state literally rolled, and then they ended up with a megalomaniacal little emperor by the name of Napoleon. But how did all of this change the world, and how did it lead to other, more successful revolutions around the world? Watch this video and find out. Spoiler alert: Marie Antoinette never said, ""Let them eat cake."" Sorry.

9RQ-Ha9JmpI,"The Harlem Renaissance:  The Rise of African American Literature, Art, and Music","This short film, produced and created by Rob Johnson of San Rafael, CA,  is an introduction to an interdisciplinary unit on the Music, Art, and Literature of the Harlem Renaissance. The Harlem Renaissance (also known as the Black Literary Renaissance and the New Negro Movement) refers to the flowering of African American cultural and intellectual life during the 1920s and 1930s. At the time, it was known as the ""New Negro Movement"", named after the 1925 anthology The New Negro edited by Alain Locke. Centered in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, the movement impacted urban centers throughout the United States. Across the cultural spectrum (literature, drama, music, visual art, dance) and also in the realm of social thought (sociology, historiography, philosophy), artists and intellectuals found new ways to explore the historical experiences of black America and the contemporary experiences of black life in the urban North. Challenging white paternalism and racism, African-American artists and intellectuals rejected imitating the styles of Europeans and white Americans and instead celebrated black dignity and creativity. Asserting their freedom to express themselves on their own terms, they explored their identities as black Americans, celebrating the black culture that had emerged out of slavery, as well as cultural ties to Africa. The Harlem Renaissance had a profound impact not only on African-American culture but also on the cultures of the African diaspora. Afro-Caribbean artists and intellectuals from the British West Indies, who had migrated to New York in number, were part of the movement. Moreover, many French-speaking black writers from African and Caribbean colonies who lived in Paris were also influenced by the Harlem Renaissance.[1] Historians disagree as to when the Harlem Renaissance began and ended. It is unofficially recognized to have spanned from about 1919 until the early or mid 1930s. Many of its ideas lived on much longer. The zenith of this ""flowering of Negro literature"", as James Weldon Johnson preferred to call the Harlem Renaissance, is placed between 1924 (the year that Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life hosted a party for black writers where many white publishers were in attendance) and 1929 (the year of the stock market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression). In 1917 Hubert Harrison, ""The Father of Harlem Radicalism,"" founded the Liberty League and The Voice, the first organization and the first newspaper of the ""New Negro Movement"". Harrison's organization and newspaper were political, but also emphasized the arts (his newspaper had ""Poetry for the People"" and book review sections). In 1927, in the Pittsburgh Courier, Harrison challenged the notion of the renaissance. He argued that the ""Negro Literary Renaissance"" notion overlooked ""the stream of literary and artistic products which had flowed uninterruptedly from Negro writers from 1850 to the present"", and said the so-called ""renaissance"" was largely a white invention.

BmZ8Miogq54,The History of North Sentinel Island - And Why it&#39;s Illegal to Visit,"With the killing of US Missionary John Allen Chau on the 25th November 2018, a small island in the Indian Ocean called North Sentinel Island became a household name - and his Neolithic, violently isolationist, tribal Sentinelese killers the subject of amazement and mystery. Having lived on their island for around 60,000, they are the modern population group we know the least about, every attempt to land on North Sentinel Island ending in an attack mounted by armed tribesmen on the beach. In this video I'll look at the history of the island and look at how modern events unfolding there can be of anthropological use when looking at the past.

This episode covers the 1956 Hungarian revolution in which Hungary, under Imre Nagy, demanded independence from the USSR's sphere of influence.

Recommended books:

Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945 by Tony Judt. Best book on the period available. Absolutely phenomenal and a complete tome (worth every penny, though).

A Concise History of Hungary by Mikl√≥s Moln√°r. Like all of the other books in this series its a fantastic introduction to all Hungarian history. Not the cheapest but still a great book for people interested in both Communist and all other Hungarian history.",History

p_eFqKekUFQ,The Kabbalah of Technology: Getting Comfortable With the Invisible,"So much has been said and written about the breathtaking wonders of our technological age. Technology's negative impact has also been covered -- how it has depersonalized us, undermined intimacy and caused some of us to lose our souls. But one thing glaringly missing from the discourse is the ""soul"" of technology: What spiritual values does it represent and what transcendent opportunities does ot offer us? How does modern science and hi tech reflect the mystical? Can we bridge the ""soul"" and ""body"" of technology? Can we benefit from its blessings without compromising our integrity?

Please join Rabbi Jacobson in this timely and relevant talk on the deeper meaning of technology, and its power to create convergence and fusion of matter and spirit. Discover hidden dimensions in technology, which will give you a fresh glimpse into hidden dimensions of your psyche and of the cosmos. Learn what truly makes technology tick and how it can help you uncover the forces that make you tick, and perhaps also give you a peek into what the future holds.

...and Grass: The History of Marijuana narrated by Woody Harrelson http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/grass/

Magic Weed : The Truth About Cannabis Sativa traces the story of the Cannabis plant, which has been known to mankind for thousands of years and how it serves us in so many ways. The sacred herb was always seen by Shamans and the ancients as a gift from the Creator God(s) of life on Earth. Like food nourishes the body, Cannabis provides nourishment for the mind and works it‚Äôs magic with the soul. Also explored in this documentary is the American relationship with hemp, including it‚Äôs ban during the 1920?s and the various uses of the hemp plant. 

Cannabis Sativa is an annual plant in the Cannabaceae family. It is a herb that has been used throughout recorded history by humans as a source of fiber, for its seed oil, as food, as medicine and for spiritual purposes. Different parts of the plant have different uses, and different varieties are cultivated in different ways and harvested at different times, depending on the purpose for which it is grown. Cannabis or Ganja is associated with Shiva, who is popularly believed to like the hemp plant.",History

jAInt7hIZlU,The Making of a Steinway - A Steinway &amp; Sons Factory Tour Narrated by John Steinway,"The making of a Steinway piano is a time-honored process involving the hands of many skilled craftspeople over the course of almost a full year. Steinway & Sons pianos are built in just two factories worldwide - one in Astoria, NY and one in Hamburg, Germany. Both factories have been building pianos for well over a century, and although Steinway has always been at the cutting edge in utilizing and perfecting the latest technology where it could make the piano better, we have found that certain things are simply better when done by skilled craftspeople than by a machine. For that reason, many parts of the process in building a Steinway have remained essentially unchanged for generations. So much so, that we were able to take decades-old audio from a narrated factory tour by the late John H. Steinway (great-grandson of Henry E. Steinway, who founded our great company in 1853) and use it as the narration for footage shot at the Steinway NY factory in 2011 by Ben Niles, producer of the documentary film ""Note by Note"" (http://www.notebynotethemovie.com). 

We hope you enjoy this look inside the Steinway New York factory, narrated in detail by the late, great John Steinway.

It is our pleasure to show you around our manufacturing plant for the original 2cv, Mehari and Dyane chassis.

Did you know?

The Mehari 2cv Club Cassis has signed an exclusive operating contract with CITROEN for the remanufacturing of many pieces using the original moulds and tools.

Are you ready?

Come and discover our universe.

The first step is to put in place all the interior frame elements, the inside rails, 

the suspension unit traverses, 

hand brake support, 

safety belt fixings, rear arched reinforcement ...

the support for the front seat rails, and the front arched reinforcement.  

The front traverse is numbered to ensure that the procedure of quality is followed for the production of each chassis.

The elements are positioned and locked together. The first welding points are made.

After this step, all holding points are released, we move to the second assembly phase.

The structure is placed on its lower panel and positioned on the second unit in the assembly line. 

It is  locked in place, and further welding points are made.

The internal reinforcements, and upper panel are put in place. 


A template is used which allows the welder to weld the upper panel and internal side frame to the original Citro√´n specifications. 

We are not yet in the era of the robotisation.

This step is complete, we move on to the 3rd phase.

The installation of the outer side frame panels.

Again, all is locked. 

The original template is laid on top and the welding is carried out following the template. 

After the upper welding is complete, the lower part can be welded.

The ends are crimped using a mallet.  

The chassis is then installed in the original Citro√´n frame crimping machine.

This machine folds the edges of the chassis in one passage back and forth.

The platform will now be installed on the original Citro√´n hole punching machine.

The holes positions are checked.

The machine will now punch over 60 holes at the same time.

The external elements will be added.

The shock absorber and spring tube supports.

The rear towing loops.

The rear exhaust support.

The front towing loops.

The elements are locked in place.

The elements are welded into place.

The elements are released and the welding is finished.

The chassis is then moved to the rotating welding table.

The front and rear axel fixations are locked and welded into place.

The lower reinforcements for the suspension spring tubes are fitted. 

Everything is unlocked.

All that is left to do, is install the fuel tank fixations.

The final step before the anti-corrosion treatment, is to install the driveshaft protection.

We hope you enjoyed the visit.

After production we have two types of anti-corrosion treatment possible.

The hot dip galvanisation at 480 ¬∞c.

Or by cataphoresis treatment.

In both cases you benefit from a high quality product protected against corrosion.

I would like to remind you that our chassis are certified and comply with the UTAC standards as required by the manufacturer.

Thank you for your attention.  Safe driving.",Manufacturing

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra7dDWgGaqI




Take a moment and think about it. Remember it, Share it and maybe, just maybe, we can be great again!

The point of this video? Not to create animosity nor give an audience to hateful statements from people who, because of their own apathy, in part created the world we now live. The point of this video is to make anyone who cares to pull together and stop the down fall as best as they can. To be good to one another and stop blaming everybody else for our own short comings. To heal ourselves so that we can heal others. Not as separate parts, but as a whole sum of Humanity!

This video has now been seen in 190+ countries!
Still people don't seem to be getting the point.
I am a human being just as you. Doing things for the right reasons just as you.
If you're not treating your fellow man (Mankind) (Human Beings) with compassion, or at least treating them as you would be treated, then how are you helping the situation.
And if you're not helping the situation, then what are you doing?
Its not about invisible lines that divide us rather human qualities that unit us.

It's a lie to think your not good enough. There are two entities in the world.
1. Evil This is where one feels Anger, Jealousy, Greed, Resentment, Lies, and Inferiority.
2. Goodness This is where one feels Joy, Peace, Love, Hope, Humility, Kindness, Empathy and Truth.
As I read over the comments I see both Evil and Goodness shared. It is not a country that is evil or good. Rather it is a personal choice of the people in any country to be either Good or Evil. And they do so through their actions.",History

Talad Rot Fai (‡∏ï‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏î‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏î‡∏£‡∏ñ‡πÑ‡∏ü), also known as the Train night market in Bangkok, or Talad Rot Fai in Thai, is one of the most popular night markets in Bangkok - this branch located at Ratchada. Here‚Äôs a map link: https://goo.gl/maps/EVKBg2ws46t

By the way, this is Part 2 of this Night Market Thai street food tour. You can watch the gigantic tom yum challenge here: https://youtu.be/4eZbr5qDxio

The market is known for its unique Thai street food, some of the snacks and dishes which are invented there and you won‚Äôt find anywhere else in Bangkok.

Laeng Saeb (‡πÄ‡∏•‡πâ‡∏á‡πÅ‡∏ã‡πà‡∏ö) at Diaw Maekhlong Restaurant (‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡πÅ‡∏°‡πà‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏≠‡∏á) - Laeng saeb, a dish of pork bones and ridiculous amounts of green chilies is one of the most popular Thai street food inventions at Talad Rot Fai, and this is mainly what I came to eat. The restaurant is located at the back of the market, and they have a few different sizes you can choose from.

XXL Laeng Saeb (‡πÄ‡∏•‡πâ‡∏á‡πÅ‡∏ã‡πà‡∏ö) - Price - 599 THB ($18.96) - We went straight for the XXL size, a massive platter of pork bones, soup, insane amounts of green chilies and the soup broth. Of all the Thai street food I‚Äôve eaten, this is one of the most unbelievable and insanely giant street foods of Thailand I‚Äôve ever seen or eaten. Although it‚Äôs way more than I ever care to eat again in one sitting, it‚Äôs actually a really good dish.

Crispy butter (‡πÄ‡∏ô‡∏¢‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏ö) - 35 THB ($1.11)
Stir fried ice cream (‡πÑ‡∏≠‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏°‡∏ú‡∏±‡∏î) - 69 THB ($2.18)
Coconut shake (‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏°‡∏∞‡∏û‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ß‡∏õ‡∏±‡πà‡∏ô) - 35 THB ($1.11)

And that completed this Thai street food night market tour of Talad Rot Fai. It‚Äôs well worth a visit, and you can of course, order smaller sizes of laeng saeb when you‚Äôre in Bangkok. Enjoy!

Speaker
Keith Gendreau - Goddard 

The Neutron Star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER) is an X-ray astrophysics mission of opportunity that will reveal the inner workings of neutron stars, cosmic lighthouses that embody unique gravitational, electromagnetic, and nuclear-physics environments. NICER achieves this objective by deploying a high-heritage instrument as an attached payload on a zenith-side ExPRESS Logistics Carrier (ELC) aboard the International Space Station (ISS). NICER offers order-of-magnitude improvements in time-coherent sensitivity and timing resolution beyond the capabilities of any X-ray observatory flown to date. Through a cost-sharing opportunity between the NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) and NASA Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) NICER will also demonstrate how neutron stars can serve as deep-space navigation beacons to guide humankind out of Earth orbit, to destinations throughout the Solar System and beyond. I will overview the NICER mission, discuss our experience working with the ISS, and describe the process of forging a partnership between SMD and STMD.",Science and Technology

p3m0i64_DIQ,The Politics of Innovation: Why Some Countries Are Better Than Others at Science and Technology,"Perhaps one of the most interesting and least well understood questions in technology and innovation policy is why some countries are good at innovation and others are not. In his book The Politics of Innovation, Georgia Tech professor Mark Zachary Taylor synthesizes more than 50 years of theory and research on national innovation rates, bringing together the current political and economic wisdom and the latest findings about how nations become science and technology leaders. The book draws on statistical analysis and comparative case studies from the United States, Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Turkey, Israel, Russia and a dozen other countries across Western Europe.

Please join ITIF for a fascinating discussion with the author to better understand the politics of innovation and the implications for the United States.",Science and Technology

In which John Green teaches you about the Progressive Era in the United States. In the late 19th and early 20th century in America, there was a sense that things could be improved upon. A sense that reforms should be enacted. A sense that progress should be made. As a result, we got the Progressive Era, which has very little to do with automobile insurance, but a little to do with automobiles. All this overlapped with the Gilded Age, and is a little confusing, but here we have it. Basically, people were trying to solve some of the social problems that came with the benefits of industrial capitalism. To oversimplify, there was a competition between the corporations' desire to keep wages low and workers' desire to have a decent life. Improving food safety, reducing child labor, and unions were all on the agenda in the Progressive Era. While progress was being made, and people were becoming more free, these gains were not equally distributed. Jim Crow laws were put in place in the south, and immigrant rights were restricted as well. So once again on Crash Course, things aren't so simple.

HsLbV92JFMc,The Quest For Evolution ‚Äì Bruce Barton,"Most people assume that the concept of evolution began with Charles Darwin.  But Darwin merely popularized and provided a supposedly scientific explanation for evolution, an idea that has been around for a long time.  A thread of evolutionary thought may be traced back to the earliest recorded civilization. In this presentation we trace evolutionism back to its early beginnings and show how it influenced Greek philosophy, which in turn affected Western culture from the Renaissance down to the present, and became deeply rooted in our culture today.

 Bruce Barton has degrees in meteorology and theology, with studies in engineering and graduate work in atmospheric sciences. Mr. Barton was an instrumentation engineer in R&D for Weyerhaeuser Company until retirement. He has a broad background as a teacher and speaker to groups of all ages in a wide range of subjects including science and technology, aviation, and Bible topics, particularly apologetics. Bruce has been speaking on the Creation/Evolution controversy for over ten years, especially to homeschool groups. He continues to give seminars and lead field trips for them.",Science and Technology
H03o2WCBoDU,The real reason manufacturing jobs are disappearing | Augie Picado,"We've heard a lot of rhetoric lately suggesting that countries like the US are losing valuable manufacturing jobs to lower-cost markets like China, Mexico and Vietnam -- and that protectionism is the best way forward. But those jobs haven't disappeared for the reasons you may think, says border and logistics specialist Augie Picado. He gives us a reality check about what global trade really looks like and how shared production and open borders help us make higher quality products at lower costs.

Vufba_ZcoR0,The Renaissance: Was it a Thing? - Crash Course World History #22,"In which John Green teaches you about the European Renaissance. European learning changed the world in the 15th and 16th century, but was it a cultural revolution, or an evolution? We'd argue that any cultural shift that occurs over a couple of hundred years isn't too overwhelming to the people who live through it. In retrospect though, the cultural bloom in Europe during this time was pretty impressive. In addition to investigating what caused the Renaissance and who benefitted from the changes that occurred, John will tell you just how the Ninja Turtles got mixed up in all this.

In which John Green teaches you about the rise of the conservative movement in United States politics. So, the sixties are often remembered for the liberal changes that the decade brought to America, but lest you forget, Richard Nixon was elected to the presidency during the sixties. The conservative movement didn't start with Nixon though. Modern conservatism really entered mainstream consciousness during the 1964 presidential contest between incumbent president and Kennedy torch-bearer Lyndon B Johnson, and Republican senator Barry Goldwater. While Goldwater never had a shot in the election, he used the campaign to talk about all kinds of conservative ideas. At the same time, several varying groups, including libertarian conservatives and moral conservatives, began to work together. Goldwater's trailblazing and coalition building would pay off in 1968 when Richard Nixon was elected to the White House, and politics changed forever when Nixon resigned over the Watergate scandal. You'll also learn about the ERA, , EPA, OSHA, the NTSB, and several other acronyms and initialisms.

5w30XgACSAg,The royal weddings that shaped European history,"To Queen Victoria, marriages were about strategic alliances.

Correction: At 5:38, the map of post-war Germany is missing eastern Prussia. The borders of Austria-Hungary should also include portions of northern Serbia and southern Poland.

This video was produced in collaboration between Vox and BBCThree.

Over the course of her 63-year reign, Queen Victoria strategically planned marriages to place her descendants in royal families all over Europe. In doing so, she created one of the most remarkable royal families in history. 

By the early 19th century, Europe had been at war for decades. After the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars killed millions, European leaders came together to restore peace by reshaping major states for a new balance of power. Great Britain went on to become one of the strongest states. And years later, Queen Victoria and her husband Albert came up with a plan to maintain that political power ‚Äî they married their children to monarchs across Europe. By the 1880s Queen Victoria‚Äôs children were in several important branches of Europe‚Äôs monarchies. 

The royal unions didn't play out as Queen Victoria planned, but she continued to make more matches anyway. She had 42 grandchildren, and these 7 ended up on royal thrones. Her grandchildren would end up on the thrones of Britain, Russia, Germany, Romania, Norway, and Spain leading up to the most destructive war Europe had ever seen.  

To truly understand the international conflicts and trends shaping our world you need a big-picture view. Video journalist Sam Ellis uses maps to tell these stories and chart their effects on foreign policy.

bl2iGoOzB4o,The Science of Addiction,"Addiction is one of the most common forms of mental illness in the world. Tens of millions of Americans and over a quarter of a billion people worldwide have an addiction to drugs or alcohol. Everyone who has watched a loved one suffer from addiction wonders, ‚ÄúWhy are they acting like this? Why can‚Äôt they stop?‚Äù And people with addictions wonder the same things about themselves. Many people think of addiction as a moral failing, or as a conscious choice‚Äîneither belief is supported by scientific evidence.

Over the past 30 years, great strides have been made in the scientific understanding of addiction, and this understanding has led to improved outcomes for those afflicted. As this research continues, we will see further progress in the prevention, treatment, and outcome for addiction.

This program will give an overview of the most up-to-date understanding of addiction as a disease of the brain. Some of the top experts in Chicago and in the nation will discuss how addiction changes the brain, what the experience of addiction is like, and what therapies are in development to treat people with this disease.

Welcome to the best tacos in the world - the ultimate guide to Mexican street food tacos in Mexico City!

I met up with Lalo from La Ruta de la Garnacha (https://www.youtube.com/user/vpedoardo), he‚Äôs from Mexico City, he makes videos about street food as well. And he took me to his favorite tacos in all of Mexico City. We each ate the most tacos in one single day that we‚Äôd ever eaten in our lives, and it was the greatest taco day of my life!

Here are all the places we ate in this video:

Tacos Joven - They are known for their tacos de canasta, which are basket tacos, famous in Mexico City. They are served from a basket, and they keep hot the entire day as they are served. The highlight here was the chicharr√≥n taco with chicharr√≥n salsa.
Price - 13 MXN ($0.70) per taco

Taqueria El Abanico - This is Lalo‚Äôs favorite restaurant in Mexico City for carnitas, the wildly popular braised pork taco. The entire rib in my taco was the highlight, so tender and flavorful.
Price - 20 MXN ($1.08) per taco

El Pescadito de Sonora - Originating from Hermosillo in Sonora, El Pescadito serves Mexican seafood tacos, especially shrimp or marlin tacos. Their tacototo is a taco that will change your life. This was as good as food gets for me.
Price - 35 MXN ($1.89) per taco

Tacos Charly - When it comes to Mexican street food, suadero is one of the greatest, a massive pan of slow braising beef in its juices. When you order your tacos, they slice up the meat, dip your tortilla in the fat, and you eat it with onions, cilantro, and salsa - pure meat heaven.
Price - 13 MXN ($0.70) per taco

Taqueria Los G√ºeros - Tacos de tripa, intestines, are very popular in Mexico City as well. They may not be the most pretty tacos, but they are immensely flavorful and have all sorts of different textures going on in your mouth.
Price - 13 MXN ($0.70) per taco

Tacos Los Juanes - This is a great Mexican street food restaurant in Mexico City that serves all sorts of different tacos. We came for the tacos de cabeza and tacos de lengua, both of which were fantastic
Price - 10 MXN ($0.54) per taco

El Vilsito - For Mexican street food in Mexico City, the ultimate taco, the most loved by everyone is no doubt, Al Pastor. Cooked in the vertical spit, a technique brought over from Lebanese immigrants, Al Pastor is usually made with marinated pork that‚Äôs juicy and flavorful it might make you weep tears of joy. Lalo and I ordered, not just your ordinary tacos de al pastor, but the King of all tacos, the Gringa!
Price - 50 MXN ($2.70) each

Thanks again to Lalo from La Ruta de la Garnacha: https://www.youtube.com/user/vpedoardo

This was the greatest taco day of my life. Thank you for watching!

kcl98aBRkD8,The Unfortunate History of the AMC Pacer - Documentary Film,"Behind all the jokes and insults, the AMC Pacer is actually a car with a great deal of history.  It began as radical new design from an underdog company.  In an attempt to combat the big, bland, boxy cars from Detroit's ""Big Three,"" little American Motors Corporation decided to build something a little different.  Their one-eyed car stylist Dick Teague proposed a small, wide car with big windows and smooth aerodynamics.  Americans had never seen anything like it.
 This in-depth documentary tells the true story of the Pacer.  Unbeknownst to many, the car persevered through manufacturing setbacks, government regulations, and many other troubles.  Featuring a ton of old car advertisements and rare footage of AMC's factory, the film helps paint a picture of the Pacer's world.  Director Joe Ligo sits down with AMC stylist Vincent Geraci, author Patrick Foster, and television personalities John Davis and Pat Goss from PBS's MotorWeek.",History

zKLH-N_X5j4,The Worst Punishments For Women In History That You Can&#39;t Believe,"‚ùÄ ‚ô° ‚ô™    Instead of punishing with death, ancient and modern nations have created many forms of cruel torture exclusively for women ...
10 most terrifying tortures in history
Boiling public opinion: 6-year-old baby tortured by her mother and mistress like an enemy
Horror: Tortured and burned because of suspected witch
""Rustic"" - Sitting wooden horse

When convicted of adultery, the woman was stripped of all her clothes and tied to a torture device with a saddle / donkey shape, in the middle there was a rough round wooden stick similar to the penis attached to the wheel shaft to move, some even get nailed around.


The wooden penis will be plugged into the vagina, when the horse runs, it will bump up on the vulva, causing the offender to bleed and suffer, and the victim will scream miserably.

Most people who are tortured in this form cannot escape death, and if they do, they will be disabled for life.

Hand clamps

This penalty was applied in Chinese feudal dynasties, which lasted until the end of Qing dynasty (19th century). This is also the most popular torture instrument for women during this period.

The woman suspected of adultery will have to put her fingers into a specialized tool for torture. This device will squeeze the victim's fingertip.

If it is too painful, the victim will faint, the cold water will be flushed to the province to continue suffering.

In addition, this form also appeared in Middle Eastern European countries with a device called ""hand grip"".

They are designed in all sizes to crush every part of the female body, from the hands, feet to the knees, even the head of the offender.

You can either poison your mind or feed it. You can choose to drown in the mainstream or forge a new path all on your own. You are watching Anonymous because you‚Äôve woken up to the lie. You are aware that there is more to our story than we‚Äôve been led to believe. We‚Äôve found a great resource to uncovering deep truths, hidden agendas and suppressed wisdom that you need to be aware of. It‚Äôs called Gaia. We‚Äôve teamed up with them to amplify our message and continue to move the masses towards positive change. Gaia‚Äôs mission is to empower the evolution of consciousness and we share a similar belief‚Ä¶ if enough of us wake up, we all wake up. This is how we win. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. http://bit.ly/SupportGaia

Arcane accounts from Egypt, Greece, Rome and Sumeria tell startling similar stories of the oceanic destruction of advanced civilizations which vanished into the world‚Äôs oceans and forgotten to the ravages of time. New technology scouring the vast depths are discovering the ruins of these lost lands. To the disbelief of established scientific communities, the evidence gathered correlates to surviving tales of an antediluvian world predating the establishment of G√∂bekli Tepe. These lost cities tell of the ongoing conflict between Enki and Enlil hold the secrets to unlocking the ancient code of human origin and destiny. This presentation was originally webcast October 24, 2017.

TOPICS FROM THE EPISODE:

‚úì Discoveries Rewrite Human History ‚Äì Scientists analyze clues of recently discovered sunken cities that correlate with disregarded mythology of ancient cities.

‚úì Ancient Battles ‚Äì Scholars trace evidence of the battle between Enki and Enlil from ancient Sumer to sunken cities in the Azores and Canary Islands.

‚úì Civilization is Older than Previously Accepted ‚Äì Discovery of sunken sites near Cuba, in the Caribbean and Azores, prove human civilization is older than 11,000 years.

‚úì An Interplanetary Exodus ‚Äì Researchers theorize the destruction of a planet between Mars and Jupiter spawned a migration that gave rise to ancient civilizations on Earth.

DM8U9h6QSCI,Top 10 Famous and DEADLY SWORDS (And Their History),"The first sword appeared during the Bronze Age.  It was made of copper and was uncovered at the Harappan sites in present-day Pakistan.  By the Middle Ages iron and steel swords were being mass produced and used in battle.  Soldiers were trained in swordsmanship and prepared for combat.  It was before the era of guns and high powered artillery and face to face fighting was the norm.  During this time in history, all of the royal generals, kings, and emperors owned personal swords.  These weapons were manufactured by the greatest sword makers of the time.  Many historical manuscripts document events surrounding significant swords.  This article will be examining ten world famous swords that still survive today.  Mythological and legendary swords will not be listed.

Eyzh-YOqNBU,Top 18 Fat Burning Foods For Women,"The top 18 foods that women should eat to lose weight fast and burn fat fast. It isn‚Äôt easy to lose weight fast. People always say that a lifestyle change needs to be made in order to lose the weight and keep it off. We are also told that to lose weight we need to eat healthier and work out regularly. Well, it‚Äôs true, and in this video, we‚Äôll count down the top foods women should eat when they are trying to lose weight!

#WeightLoss #BurnFat #LoseWeight

Music:
https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music

Summary:
18. Citrus Fruits: According to a study done in 2016 by the American Chemical Society, citrus fruits can prevent obesity-related heart disease, diabetes, and liver disease. One way to get more citrus in your diet is by adding them to your water.

17. Walnuts: We have known for a while that eating nuts is good for you, but now we know which ones are the best to eat. A study in the journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism found that walnuts, in particular, contain an ingredient that can satisfy your appetite, making you feel fuller for longer. This will cause you eat less!

16. Popcorn: The University of Scranton performed a study that found that popcorn contains large amounts of polyphenols. Polyphenols are linked to many health benefits such as improved digestion and better blood circulation. If you don‚Äôt add any salt, butter or oil, and if you air pop your popcorn, this can be a great healthy snack to help you lose weight.

15. Berries: Scientists at Harvard University found in 2016 that increasing the daily intake of berries, such as blueberries and strawberries, can help people lose weight for the long term. It is said that the reason for this is because berries have high amounts of flavonoids which have been linked to weight loss.

14. Whole Grains: A Tufts University study proved that people who eat three or more daily servings of whole grains such as oatmeal had 10 percent less belly fat than people who ate the same amount of white carbs. This is said to be because whole grains are higher in fiber, which keeps you full for longer.

13. Avocados: A study published in the journal Internal Medicine Review found that avocados can help people lose weight for many reasons. The reason for this weight loss is because avocados are rich in many nutrients that help with higher intakes of fiber, healthy fats, vitamins E and C, folate, magnesium, copper and potassium. 

12. Cayenne Pepper: The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition performed a study that found that daily consumption of one of the compounds found in pepper speeds up abdominal fat loss. It does this by boosting the body‚Äôs ability to convert food into energy. Next time you‚Äôre cooking, add some cayenne pepper to spice up some meat or vegetarian dishes.

11. Salmon: A 2015 study from Kyoto University found that salmon helps your body transform fatty white fat cells into fat-burning beige cells. Salmon helps build muscle when following a steady workout routine. It also contains the right types of fats, such as Omega-3s, which helps your body burn more fat.

10. Cinnamon: Researchers at the University of Michigan have found that cinnamaldehyde, which is an essential oil in cinnamon, activates thermogenesis. Thermogenesis is a metabolic bodily process that helps burn calories and produce heat. So if you add some cinnamon to your oatmeal in the morning, you‚Äôre literally going to be burning fat cells.

9. Apples and Pears: Research which was posted on the US National Library of Medicine in 2003 stated the results of a study by the State University of Rio de Janeiro on a correlation between apples, pears, and weight loss. Women were instructed to eat apples, pears, or oatmeal cookies three times a day. After 12 weeks the group that had a fruit supplement lost more weight and had a greater decrease in blood glucose than the group that ate the oatmeal cookies.

8. Chicken: A 2013 study in the medical journal Obesity found that boosting dietary protein decreases total body fat and abdominal fat and helps increase lean body mass and your body‚Äôs energy expenditure during periods of weight maintenance and weight loss.

Chinese food. Chinese street food. I love you. The cuisine I sampled in the last year living in China was unreal. I've combined my top 5 Chinese food picks into one video. I mostly eat Sichuan food, so there may be some bias, but believe me, the food I ate this year, whether Chinese street food or Chinese market food or eating at nice Chinese restaurants, I've narrowed down into 5 delicious picks for you!

The addresses will be updated on this video soon:

Number 5:
""On the paper fish"" - Á∫∏‰∏äÁÉ§È±º ""Zhi shang kaoyu""
This is a grilled fish ""on the paper"", so that there is no charring of any ingredients and all the flavours of the spicy and garlicky broth are soaked into the fish. You also order additional ingredients, like eggs, lotus root, tofu, potato, cilantro, and greens. I ate this one in Chengdu. It's a great Chengdu food to try.

Number 4 - Leshan duck - ÁîúÁöÆÈ∏≠ ""Tian pi ya""
This is the famous Leshan ""sweet skinned duck"". It's stewed in ginger, onions, sugar, salt, star anise, Sichuan peppercorn, cinnamon, fennel, cloves, and cardamom. It's super easy and this is one of my favourite ducks in all of China.

Number 3 - Firewood Chicken - Êü¥ÁÅ´È∏° ""Chaihuoji""
This was truly a magical experience. A whole chicken is chopped up and put into a wok heated by wood fire. It's boiled in a wok full of Sichuan broad bean paste and dried chilies, making it super spicy, juicy, and salty.  The wok is full of other vegetable ingredients that you personally order. I ordered potatoes to keep it classic. The best part of the whole meal is when they take a dough and place it on the side of the wok and put the lid over it, making these gooey and sticky and crispy on the outside. So satisfying. Another great Sichuan food to try in Chengdu.

Number 2 -Xinjiang food
Xinjiang food is a huge culinary world that I can't say I've fully sampled. But what I did try in Urumqi was amazing. I had a meal at a traditional Xinjiang restaurant that was 3 main Xinjiang foods: Pumpkin and Lamb steamed buns, Xinjiang Lamb Kebabs, and A lamb and onion and black pepper ""rounang"" stuffed bread.

Number 1 - Tibetan food- ""Xizang cai""
I tried this food at the four girls mountain range in Western Sichuan. This meal was so so satisfying and really rich and heavy. It consisted of spicy yak meat, fresh local potatoes, fresh local first growth forest hand picked greens fried up in a wok with yak butter, fresh tibetan ""butter tea"", and blood sausage. Yet the best part of this meal was eating with the local people of the area. They were so welcoming and friendly and it really felt like a once in a lifetime experience to just sit down and chat with them in their little living room heated by a wood stove in the coldest part of the winter. What a try experience!

Was there something that you think I should have put in this list? What would you like to try most? What are your thoughts about this video? Leave me a comment below about anything, I love hearing from you!

#NAME?,Traditional Enamel Dial Manufacturing,"Dials made of enamel can last forever, have a great smooth aspect, are prestigious because of their very artisenal production process and have existed since the 17th century. We find them today in historical pieces visible in museums. This technique was used until the beginning of the 20th century. Then metal dials replaced them because it became possible to add colorful decorations. Since then, enamel has used mostly been used on exclusive watches. 

Enamel is composed of glass powder extracted from silica. We don‚Äôt produce enamel powder ourselves; we buy it from companies mostly based in France, the United Kingdom, and the United-States. They contain metal oxides that give different colors to the substance, essentially added to transparent enamels. The whiteness and opacity of the white enamel dial comes from the breakdown of arsenic. But today, there is no substitute for obtaining the whiteness we have on our dials, for instance. We work following the same traditional method used before.

This starts with a disc made out of copper. This precise metal is used because of its maneuverability. It allows us to create dials with different shapes, both domed and flat. First, we weld feet to the back of the disc. Then we heat the dial to about 950¬∞C to relax the metal. The process continues by cleaning it and scrubbing it to reintroduce some tension. Thus, the piece remains solid during the next operations. The first layers of enamel are put on the back and front of the dial at the same time by dusting enamel powder before putting it in the kiln for the first time. The back layer is necessary as every new one added on the front adds tension to the metal. Without it, the dial would bend and finally break.

A dial made out of enamel is like gold: timeless.",Manufacturing
kwozInrGog0,Traditional manufacturing of childrens wooden toys in Hrvatsko Zagorje,"UNESCO: Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity - 2009
URL: http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/RL/00233
Description: Villagers along the pilgrimage route to the Marian shrine of Our Lady of the Snow in Marija Bistrica in Hrvatsko Zagorje in northern Croatia developed a technique for traditional manufacturing of childrens wooden toys that has now been handed down for generations. The men in a family take soft willow, lime, beech and maple wood from the region and dry, hew, cut and carve it using traditional tools; the women then apply ecologically-friendly paint in improvisational floral or geometric patterns, painting from imagination. The whistles, horses, cars, tiny furniture, spinning dancers, jumping horses and flapping birds produced today are almost identical to those made more than a century ago  though no two toys are precisely the same, thanks to the handcrafted production process. Popular among both locals and tourists, these toys are sold in parish fairs, markets and specialty shops around the world. They have also evolved with the times and, in addition to the traditional shapes such as horses and carts, new ones representing cars, trucks, airplanes and trains have appeared, reflecting the world surrounding modern-day children. Tiny toy instruments, carefully tuned as they are created, still serve as important components in the musical education of rural children.

xTMarg1dGRk,Transparency| Successful Single Mom Shares Her Struggles and Motivates Others,"I'm a single black mom (30yrs)  that has been traveling the world full time with my 9-year-old son for over a year and a half. We have traveled using several methods of transportation and have stayed in several countries using various accommodations. We are not on vacation! This is real life for us! We work and homeschool as we travel, and this is a dream come true for us! I completely carved out this lifestyle for us based on our current needs and desires now and later. We are not millionaires and we have not stayed anywhere for free using Couchsurfing, Woofing or Workaway. We think that these are great resources, and simply want people to know that they don't have to rely on these platforms to completely make their traveling dreams come true as well. Also, I forgot to mention that we have not used our credit cards, but once to rent a car. If you have ever wanted to ask us something personal about our finances and lifestyle organization...Tune in to this live stream and ask anything or comment later and we will try our best to answer anything NOT answered in the video! 

***Thank you to all who tuned in! Our live video was very interactive and I loved this. Due to slight connection interruptions on the replay,, me getting attacked by mosquitoes and length of this live stream... lol I will be rerecording this subject another time. This video will eventually be removed soon so please pull up a chair and watch later tonight if you can. I am using this experience as documentation for another learning experience. My goal is to learn how to prepare my streams better as I inform, entertain and manage a larger audience. Thank you for your patience! See you soon again.

About Us:

My name is Bionca and I have a 9 yr old son named Carter. I‚Äôm a cultured high energy globetrotting life coach, public speaker and soon to be an author. Carter is a spiritual goofy home schooled kid, gamer, and humanitarian. Together we want to inspire others to be bold enough to chase their dreams despite any challenges along the way.

 Our journey began a year ago we decided to get rid of our fancy things, home school and travel the world until further notice. Then in October 2017, we decided to buy a van that would enable us to work, home school, explore the world and give back in the U.S! This 1989 Ford Econoline is a symbol of freedom and service to various communities. 

Our values (L.E.G)
Learn
Engage
Give back

Some examples of what Carter and I love to do throughout our travels:

-Life coaching and delivering empowering speeches which include speaking on the issues of bullying in schools.
-Learn and explore various regions of the world while engaging with locals
-Cook delicious foods
-Host play date meetups for traveling families with kids
-Feed the homeless
-Rescue animals
-Clean up beaches

Right now we wish to relaunch an anti-bullying nonprofit foundation called the Bully Barricade Foundation. It is going to take a lot of work and we need your help! 

We hope to meet many of you during our travels! 
With love, 

-Bionca and Carter

OudIK1RvrAA,Travel Coffee Break #19 Thu 13 Dec 2012 (#tcbhoa),"This edition of #tcbhoa was 'open forum' - there was no scheduled topic.

I was joined from Sweden by travel writer/blogger/photographer Lola Akinmade Akerstrom and later from the USA by Tichawanda Darangwa.

Lola and I talked about the varied nature of her work and how multi-role work-styles are the norm for professional freelance travel writers/bloggers these days. Lola works for Visit Sweden through the Swedish Institute which runs the official website for Sweden, www.sweden.se. She also described her work as a photographer and as a speaker/presenter at blogger and social media conferences. We talked through several examples of bloggers creating innovative new publications and revenue streams, such as: Nellie Huang's WildJunket magazine, Kash Bhattacharya's Luxury Hostels of Europe project, the blogger's collaborative Traveller's Handbook series, and Gary Arndt's branded photographic tour.  Lola also spoke about the need for bloggers to connect and build relationships with their local tourist boards.

We were joined by Tichawanda Darangwa aka 'Tich' who has built a business paying bloggers - not just travel bloggers - to run email marketing campaigns to their subscribers. He explained how it can be a much more efficient sales driver than traditional banner advertising, link selling or affiliate advertising. He doesn't have a website but you can Google for 'Tich the great' to find him.

EJCtVohc9BE,Travel Coffee Break (#tcbhoa) Mon 07 Jan 2013 - #26 (open forum),"This edition of the Travel Coffee Break was 'Open Forum'. I was joined by travel bloggers Dylan Lowe (in Kula Lumpur) and Keith Jenkins.

We talked about iAmbassador blog trips, and Blogmanay in particular, where 21 bloggers were invited to Edinburgh for Hogmanay and then on a tour of Scotland. This morning there was an article about Blogmanay in the Scotsman. We talked about the way commercial/paid-for blog trip projects like this and the upcoming Finland Blogsposure are developing, and about the changing relationship between tourism organisations and travel writers (bloggers). We talked about Return on Investment and the new ROI online calculator tool developed by Keith and Melvin Boecher (Traveldudes). We talked about how the travel industry finds bloggers to work with and how groups and organisations like TBU and the Professional Travel Bloggers Association are developing databases to make that easier. We talked about the expanding range of bloggers being used by tourism organisations and DMOs - no longer just travel bloggers, but mom bloggers, fashion bloggers, food & wine bloggers too.

We talked about Keith's recent TEDx talk and Dylan's travel plans in Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore and Cambodia, and about his new 360 food blog. And we talked about the increasing work demands on bloggers that new projects create and how to deal with that by sharing the workload, taking on extra help, or just creating more office time while travelling.

wKA4g97ojNg,Travel Coffee Break (#tcbhoa) Thu 23 May 2013 - No. 70,"For this edition I was joined by SEO expert Ralph du Plessis from Red Mud Media, Ron Mader (in Mexico) from Planeta.com and travel writer, Ian Redmayne (Irresponsible Traveller).  There were several others who tried to join but seemed to have tech issues (disable Skype before installing the Google video messaging app needed for Hangouts).

The plan had been to discuss some of the threads and trends from last week's Travel Bloggers Unite - Europe conference in Rotterdam, attended by around 150 bloggers, plus PRs, tourism and travel industry representatives.

I did talk about some of those things (01:50), but we didn't have anyone from the conference.

I talked about the (03:45)expansion of the family - how events like TBU are opening up to other lifestyle bloggers, eg parent bloggers and fashion bloggers and the (05:16) survey of travellers and travel bloggers conducted and prsented by Gary Bembridge which demonsrates a gap between what travellers want from travel blogs and what travel bloggers think their readers want.

(09:10) Ron suggested that in some ways a wiki is a better way to post useful, up-to-date info than a blog.

(19:40) We talked about how the survey figures and ongoing topic thread in conference sessions, suggested that bloggers need to provide more factbox style useful info for their readers.

(21:55) Nick talked about practical info in guidebooks such as Bradt guides.

(41:08) I talked about how there has been a step-change in monetization for bloggers, with pro-bloggers being much more commercially adept, and creating social media marketing campaigns for tourism and travel organisations, through blogger marketing/publisher groups like iAmbassadors and Navigate Media.

(46:11) We talked about the ongoing relationship between bloggers and destination marketing organisations (DMOs) and brand advocacy.

(53:18)Ralph talked about the latest SEO developments and how it affects bloggers.

aLnchZU6w54,Travel Coffee Break (#tcbhoa) Weds 20 Feb 2013 - #42,"This edition was 'Open Forum', however there were some topics which we settled on before the start.

My guests were: Oliver Gradwell from Travel Bloggers Unite; Gary Bembridge, Marketer/blogger/podcaster from Gary Bembridge Unleashed; Vago Damitio from Vagobond.com; Simon Veness, travel writer from Venesstravelmedia.com; and Ralph du Plessis from SEO firm Red Mud Media.

Carly Morson, Publishing Manager at Red Mud, was also with us in spirit at least - her mic & webcam weren't working.

The opening topic was Google+ itself and its benefits to bloggers. This topic had originated in a G+ post from travel blogger, Cole Burmester (Four Jandals) admitting he wasn't sure he was using G+ to maximum advantage, and didn't fully understand the significance of meta attributes 'rel author' and 'rel publisher'. It was suggested that we talk it through on Travel Coffee Break.

3lFT0SYrMNc,Tron Uprising Animated Series - The Amazing Art and Theme Music -  Fan Upload,"This is a short collection of clips highlighting some of the amazing and visually striking art from the animated Tron Uprising series. The show won several awards for its art design and I personally thought it was epic. I was really sad to see it cancelled by Disney.
I didn't edit these clips together myself. This montage was actually created by Alberto Mielgo who worked as the Art Director/Production Designer for the show. The original video can be found and downloaded on Vimeo (link below). All I did here was trim and add the theme music (which seems to fit really well!).
I've uploaded this videos as a massive fan of the show and to hopefully make others aware of how excellent it is. I'd love to see it released to blu-ray someday! :)

Uzbekistan Day 5: Tandoori Lamb and Full Tour of Ancient Bukhara, Uzbekistan!

From Samarkand, we drove to Bukhara, another ancient and well preserved city in Uzbekistan. What‚Äôs great about Bukhara is that it‚Äôs an entire ancient city that was important on the Silk Road that‚Äôs well preserved and still functioning.

Kolkhoznyy Rynok Bazaar - Ravshan (https://goo.gl/QaaBDA) who I‚Äôve been traveling with in Uzbekistan is originally from Bukhara, so he was a great person to be with. We started in the morning, along with Bekruz for breakfast at the bazaar. We bought honey and kaymak then some very kind ladies at the bread market invited us to sit at their table. A perfect Uzbek breakfast to get the day started.

Great Minaret of the Kalon - Dating back to the 12th century, without a doubt, the Great Minaret of Kalon is a landmark in Bukhara. Even Genghis Khan, while in the process of destroying much of Bukhara, spared the minaret because of its vast beauty. It truly is spectacular.

Chor Bakr Restaurant - But we were very interested in a local Bukhara food speciality, tandoori lamb. So we drove out to Chor Bakr Restaurant, who prepare about 100 kg. of tandoori lamb for lunch. And luckily we arrived right as they were pulling it out of the oven!
Price per plate - 75,000 UZS ($9.08)

Magistral Plov Center - As I‚Äôve learned and probably you have too, you can‚Äôt visit a city in Uzbekistan without having plov, the national dish and ultimate dish of Uzbekistan. For this version we had Bukhara plov, quite a bit more meaty than the Samarkand version, and loaded with sheep butt.

Bolo Hauz Mosque - Another beautiful sight in Bukhara is Bolo Hauz Mosque with its impressive wooden entrance area. And across the street from the mosque you‚Äôll find Bolo Xauz Teahouse, a nice little tea house where we had a tea and snack and just relaxed for a minute. Lastly for our sightseeing of the day in Bukhara, we climbed to the top of The Ark Fortress, a huge fortified palace in Bukhara near the old city.

Labi Hovuz Restaurant - For dinner we ate at one of Bukhara‚Äôs most legendary restaurants, located in the old public square. The ambiance was great, and the hearty lamb and potato soup cooked in clay pots was delicious.

It was another wonderful day and learning experience in Uzbekistan.

If you haven‚Äôt already, you can watch the entire Uzbekistan food travel series here: https://youtu.be/A3xHJzNNM2A

Big thank you to Bekruz and the Ministry of Tourism Uzbekistan for arranging my trip to Uzbekistan.

ü•íABOUT BEFRS:
Hey, I‚Äôm Sonny! I‚Äôm from the US but currently call Vietnam home. I‚Äôve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. People either enjoyed my undeniable charm or enjoyed watching me eat things like coconut worms, and thus Best Ever Food Review Show came to be. 

I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.

Don‚Äôt forget to subscribe to Best Ever Food Review Show, so we can connect through food and travel and become Bestys!

#7 - Life On Mars
Since it has been introduced, we as a society have gotten used to the idea that Mars and probably other planets once had life on them. Although this is something we‚Äôve come to accept to be true, did you know that there is a whole new side of Mars‚Äô history that we didn‚Äôt even know about? Although Mars doesn‚Äôt look like it now, NASA members have seen evidence on the planet‚Äôs surface that leads them to believe that there was once a massive ocean covering a large portion of the northern hemisphere. With that much water, they say that the planet could have been both warm and wet which is an even better breeding ground for life than previously thought. 


#6 - Akrotiri On Thera
The preserved excavation site pictured here is Akrotiri on Thera, a rich ancient city that could possibly be the source of the famous Atlantis. Just like what had happened to the poor people of Pompeii, the Aegean city of Akrotiri was also coated in a thick layer of ash preserving it throughout the ages. The eruption occurred in 1620 BC and wasn‚Äôt truly discovered until the 1960s. This almost perfectly preserved city shows an abundance of wealth that include some astounding paintings depicting Bronze Age life. This discovery gave the world a whole new look and understanding of the Mediterranean sea trade as well as Minoan art. 


#5 - Oracle Bone Writing
There has been a recent discovery that could mean the Chinese were among the first to discover the Americas. Scattered around the southern United States was a collection of 82 old stones that don‚Äôt look like they fit in with anything else from the surrounding native cultures. The messages on the rocks are messages written in Chinese oracle bone script. Oracle bone script is one of the oldest forms of Chinese writings known. When deciphering these messages, words describing a journey seems as though it was written by people exploring a new world. If this is true then that means that the Chinese landed in North America over 3,000 years ago. 


#4 - There Are More Mayan Cities
The strange squarish platform pictured here is thought to be a huge Mayan city that was discovered by a 15-year-old named William Gadoury. This Canadian boy has a theory that Mayans chose to place their cities by following the constellations. After establishing this theory, he figured that there must be another undiscovered city in the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico and judging by this picture, it looks like he may be right. The place in question hasn‚Äôt been seen in person yet but there have been curious sighting from space which is prompting an expedition.


#3 - There‚Äôs More To King Tut‚Äôs Tomb
Being lovers of ancient Egyptian history, we love the fact that there could possibly be more to King Tut‚Äôs tomb. When re-examining the chambers of the tomb with laser scans, Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves found what appeared to be not one but two additional, untouched chambers within the tomb. One of the chambers is thought to be hidden behind the wall you see in this picture. 

After being asked what he believed was behind door number one, Reeves said that he believes, and hopes, that it is the final resting place of Queen Nefertiti. Don‚Äôt worry, they aren‚Äôt going to just bring in a wrecking ball and smash in a wall, when they are ready to reveal what‚Äôs in the hidden tombs, they‚Äôll most likely only drill tiny holes so they can insert cameras to look around. 


#2 - The Costa Rican Spheres
If the sphere pictured here looks familiar it's because they have been a hot topic since they‚Äôve been seen all around Costa Rica, sitting out in the sunshine, hanging out underwater, or like the one pictured here, almost buried completely under the dirt. It turns out that these spheres were left adorning certain towns and buildings depending on the person or people‚Äôs importance or title. The process it took to actually create these near perfect stones was such a lengthy and involved one that these stone couldn‚Äôt be given to just anyone, they had to have some sort of major social standing. 


#1 - Metal Books
The two ancient books you see here are actually ancient texts in the form of metal books. The collection found was a total of 70 of these tiny books that measured to be about the size of a credit card. On the pages of these books are symbols, characters, and markings that are believed to possibly unlock some of the most questioned secrets of some of the first days of Christianity. 

The things these books say could end up changing the way we understand the Bible. Although it appears as though some of the markings refer to a Messiah, a Crucifixion, and possibly even a Resurrection, no one has been able to understand the full context of the language written.",History

I'm in the club with my homies, tryna get a lil' v-I,
Keep it down on the low key, cause you know how it feels.
I said shawty she was checkin' up on me,
From the game she was spittin' my ear you'd think that she knew me.
So we decided to chill

Yeah (yeah) shawty got down an' said come and get me
Yeah (yeah) I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah (yeah) Her and my girl would be the best of homies

KDMztioQao4,Vicky Donor,"Dr. Baldev Chaddha (Annu Kapoor), a well-qualified fertility expert, runs a fertility clinic and a sperm bank in Daryaganj, New Delhi, which guarantees high quality and specialized sperm for each client. Unfortunately, he has more failed cases to his credit than successful ones. A healthy, high performing donor is the need of the hour. Vicky Arora (Ayushmann Khurana), a young, good-looking, Punjabi boy from Lajpat Nagar, is the financially draining only son of Dolly, a widow, who runs a small beauty parlor from home. As luck would have it, a small brawl in the colony brings Dr. Chaddha and Vicky face to face, and Chaddha concludes that Vicky could be just the donor he has been looking for. From here on, Chaddha's days and nights are spent convincing Vicky to become a donor, until he finally gives in. Vicky finds his love interest in Ashima Roy (Yaami Gautam), a pretty Bengali girl, who works in a bank. But soon, their hunky-dory world comes crashing down because of Vicky's past as a donor. A funny and emotional roller coaster ride, Vicky Donor is a light-hearted take on the subject of sperm donation.",Manufacturing

Lyrics:

Churaya hi kyu jab vo todna hi tha
Dil bi vo tuta hai jo mere paas nahi

Dikhaya hi kyu jab muh modna hi tha 
Seene mai hawa toh hai par vo saans nahi

Mere paas nahi hai koi saath nahi hai
Jo btade mujhe baat ye khaas nahi 

Dil udaas sahi hai koi aas nahi hai
Pagli ankhon ki nami hai ye barsaat nahi

*Drop*

Main bhi na jaane kaha kho gaya tha
Zindagi bhi mujhse khafa ho gayi

Jis din ki is dil ne khudse mohobat
To zindagi bhi mujhpe fida ho gayi

Mere paas nahi hai koi saath nahi hai
Or na hai ab kisika intezaar kahi

Tere baare mai na sochu aisi raat nahi hai
Par tu tode dil mera teri aukaat nahi

*Drop*

Ankhon mai dhuan tha maine dekha hi nahi
Khushi peeche hi thi khadi daabe ye hassi

Dil bhi bola sunn baaware ankhiyon ke dushman
Naa mai kabhi tuta tha na khoya tha kabhi

Tere paas yahi hu ye awaaz mai hi hu
Ye kahani teri meri hai zamane ki nahi

Mai dhadakta rahu tu bhi yu hast rahe
Duniya jaye saali bhaad mai koi parwa hi nahi

*Drop*

Ek raat jaaga main maine dekha tha saweraa",Art and Music

EAWAG (The Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology), Switzerland

""Microbial resource management in new buildings: microbial ecology influenced by consumer choices and engineering decisions""

ABSTRACT: Diverse bacterial communities assemble in drinking water plumbing systems, where both the composition and the quantity of these communities have potential long-term impacts on the consumers. Building plumbing is not regularly monitored from a microbial perspective and often treated as a microbiological black box. However, plumbing systems are in fact, controllable environments. The owners and occupants of new buildings (unwittingly) exercise critical choices in determining factors for microbial growth, for instance selecting material composition (e.g., copper pipes vs. plastic pipes), system design (e.g., number of bathrooms) and operation (e.g., warm water temperature settings). These choices affect initial biofilm formation and development, and ultimately the establishment of the building plumbing microbiome. Here, the silver lining lies in the opportunity to manage and control drinking water communities by understanding and exploiting the connections between these factors and microbial ecology. Our group focuses on initial biofilm formation and particularly the importance of pipe-related nutrients (e.g., carbon leaching from synthetic polymeric pipes such as PEX or PVC. This presentation will explore the various factors contributing to biofilm development in real plumbing systems, and whether/how these can be exploited to manage drinking water microbial communities.",Science and Technology

Zd7AqJRXaaE,We&#39;re Back! Our Trip Through The Blizzard In Our New RV,"In this Ask Us Anything, we share the new RV we'll be riding in for the next month or so - the Wonder RTB (for Rear Twin Beds) model from Leisure Travel Vans.

Jennifer and I visited the factory in Winkler, Manitoba last week and returned to our Michigan home in a borrowed Wonder RTB, a 2019 Class B+ coach that is build on the Ford Transit Chassis.

It's the first time we have driven a B+ (which is technically a Class C RV) and it's a first for driving the Ford Transit, which is increasingly becoming a popular chassis choice for RV manufacturers. We'll drive it to Florida this week and then out to Salt Lake City to attend the RVx industry trade show, where we will return it to Leisure Travel Vans.¬†

I'll do reviews on the Wonder and how the Ford Transit performs as an RV chassis as we get more experience with both.

We'll have a full video Thursday of a tour we had of the LTV factory up there in Winkler. But below is a rewind of last night's live stream in which we answered lots of audience questions and shared our experience of driving home in a blizzard and our new partnership with the folks at Leisure Travel Vans.

yvMpXPrvphE,WEP 2019 KAUST Live: Chiara Cirelli,"Chiara Cirelli is a Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. She received her medical degree and Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the University of Pisa, Italy. Dr. Cirelli‚Äôs research is aimed at investigating the fundamental mechanisms of sleep regulation by using a combination of molecular and genetic approaches. Together with her long-term collaborator, Dr. Giulio Tononi, she has developed a comprehensive hypothesis about the function of sleep, the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis, according to which sleep serves to renormalize synaptic strength, counterbalancing a net increase of synaptic strength due to plasticity during wakefulness. Without sleep, such progressive increase in synaptic strength would lead to unsustainable costs in terms of energy, space, and cellular supplies, would reduce the informativeness of neuronal signals, and would prevent further learning by bringing stronger synapses closer to their level of saturation. In short, according to this hypothesis sleep is the price to pay for brain plasticity during wakefulness.",Science and Technology
#NAME?,WEP 2019 Keynote: Salim T S Al-Hassani,"Time measurement has, throughout history and across continents, been a central part of the lives of Muslims. The need to determine the times of daily prayers as well as the start/beginning and end of the fasting days has motivated people to investigate and develop time measuring devices. Whilst Muslims developed and improved devices such as sundials and water clepsydras ‚Äî which had been inherited from ancient civilizations such as Egypt, Greece, Persia, China, and India‚Äî, they also invented devices of their own, making them popular throughout the Muslim world, stretching from China to Spain. This keynote lecture looks at the historical development of time-measuring devices, focusing on the history of clocks in the Muslim civilization. 

Popular books of science and engineering, however, have largely neglected those non-European contributions. A study of non-European, and particularly Muslim, contributions to the development of clocks, would hopefully allow us to understand the development of science and technology in greater detail and also to enhance inter-cultural respect. The lecture will demonstrate information about clocks found in manuscripts were transferred into AUTOCAD engineering drawings and Studio-Max to produce 3D animations. Focus will be made on the water clock that Caliph Harun al-Rasheed gifted Charlemagne (the holy Roman Emperor), the clock of Ibn al-Haytham, the Elephant clock of Al-Jazari, the water clock of Al-Muradi and the mechanical clock of Taqi al-Din.

It is hoped that the story of the development of clocks in the Muslim Civilisation will not only fill in a gap in the public literature but also inspire the young audience to build a prosperous, sustainable future that appreciates and celebrates the diversity of humanity.",Science and Technology

pBPXxO9E-fQ,West African Food - EXOTIC DELICACY in GHANA!,"‚ñ∫SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe
‚ñ∫T-shirts and caps available now: https://migrationology.com/store/

Bushmeat is a term that is used to often describe wild game meat in Africa. And while there some types of bushmeat that are not good or unsafe to eat - grasscutter - also known as a greater cane rat, is safe and one of the most popular types of bushmeat to eat in West Africa. It‚Äôs a delicacy!

So while we were driving on our way to Elmina, Ghana, along the side of the highway, we stopped at some hunters, and bought a grasscutter. 

Later in the day, we met up with our host family, and we drove over to the Elmina fishing market. The market was amazing, bright and colorful, and energetic, with some unique fish and seafood available from the Atlantic. We bought some fish to go along with our grasscutter, and then we continued back to the house to start cooking.

First for lunch, Mama made us a dish called Eto, a mash up of yam and palm nut oil, topped with eggs. It was a little on the dry side for me, but it was an honor to have a chance to try that special Ghanaian dish.

For dinner we prepared the fish and grasscutter. The fish was made into Ghanaian groundnut or peanut soup, which is one of the best dishes I at in Ghana. The grasscutter was made into a bushmeat grasscutter light soup which included chilies, garlic, onions, ginger, and tomato.

Finally, for the main start of the meal Mama made omo tuo, Ghana style rice balls.

How does grasscutter taste? The greater cane rats run around the fields and eat grass, so unsurprisingly some parts kind of taste like grass. But they are a white meat, and have a similar look to chicken, but the meat is even sweeter. It was also surprisingly fall apart tender. I thought it was amazing!

Across West African food, grasscutter is a very popular meat, and a delicacy eaten on special occasions.

==========================

‚úÖ Check out the full blog post over at https://realpars.com/plc-manufacturers/

Today we will discuss several of the top PLC manufacturers from around the world. 

There are quite a few, and hopefully, this video will clear up some of the differences between the major brands. 

As technicians, engineers, and programmers, we have several choices when it comes to choosing a brand of PLC. Depending on where you work, you may have to familiarize yourself with many different PLC brands.

Some places use more than one manufacturer in a single facility. So let‚Äôs break some of the major brands down so we can see the difference.

The song, ""Ay Waukin, O"" is set to Robert Burns poem by the same name.  It's in four part harmony, for womens choir.

This recording features my voice (from several years back now) overdubbed, with some reverb, to create a pseudo choir effect.  My voice sounds thin to me now, as it was still maturing when I created this.  (I ought to re-sing this someday, maybe.  :) 

Thanks for watching, I hope you enjoy!  If you want to check out more music, you can find me at vardamusic.com.

Sleep I can get nane
For thinkin' on my dearie

Lyrics:

Intro (spoken)

Yo man...
Yo I know you see me here dude!!
I've been waiting here like 10 minutes, man!
No, no no... this is MY parking space man.
What you need to do is put your little hybrid in reverse, 
And go out the way you came in.
WHAT?!?!
Yo its about to get REAL in the Whole Foods parking lot man...

Chorus  (with feeling)

It's getting' REAL in the Whole Foods Parking Lot
I got my STEEL and you know it gets sparked a lot
Im on my grind homie... It's on my mind homie!
These fools with clip boards are lookin' at me like they know me!

It's getting' REAL in the Whole Foods Parking Lot
You know the DEAL with the little shopping carts they got...
Check out what I say, it happens every day...
It's how we LIVE on the west side of LA!!

Verse 1

... Im ridin' slow in my Prius...
all leather, tinted windows... you cant see us!!
Everybody's trying to park, you can feel the tension
I'm in electric mode... can't even hear the engine (Shhhhhhh)

Just then I saw a spot open up, 
My timings perfect... Im creepin' up...
But then this other dude tried to steal it going the wrong way
Yo man, I've had a LONG DAY!

Chorus 
(same as before)

Verse 2

Now I'm on this inside, looking at my list
Organic chicken, Kale Salad and a Lemon Twist.
Some girl in yoga pants is lookin at me funny
I'm just trying to find a decent Pinot Noir for under twenty!

Then I take it to the cheese counter, Humboldt Fog?
We just ran out sir!  Really Dog?
Take it easy man, I try to calm myself...
I've been on edge ever since they took Kombucha off the shelf...

Chorus

(same as before)

Verse 3

This Busters on his iPhone talking to his friends, 
Picking up some cayenne pepper for his master cleanse.
You're the most annoying dude I've ever SEEN brah... 
Could you PLEASE move?  You're RIGHT in front of the Quinoa.

Damn, I'm about to check out.
Pay my 80 bucks for 6 things and get the heck out.
The express lane is moving hella slow...
Man, these fools don't know... that shit is getting REAL....

Chorus
(same as before)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why are 'Made in China' products cheaper than 'Made in India

So the question now is why does their product use so much? have you ever wondered ? Because he is cheap, so why is his product affordable? Why can not India make such a cheap product?

Labor is found in the lowest penny in China
China's Anual Average Productivity Growth
Most Raw Materials at Domestic Level
Competitive pricing
Expense on innovation or r & d
Duplicate product
Dumping Strategy
Product export in other countries
Break the market


So what should India do to come forward in this way?

1) Commericial rule, making bussiness easy
2) Improvement in manufacturing and agriculture sector
3) Multispecialist to Labor
4) Export has to be improved,
5) Stop buying their product

IhYmWYvqV3I,Why does the Travel Blogging Community NOT Recognize Black Travel Bloggers?,"Why does the Travel Blogging Community NOT Recognize Black Travel Bloggers?

Response to White House Travel Blogger Summit
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeHZvOQJiaY


The White House recently invited travel bloggers to attend the White House Travel Blogger Summit on Study Abroad and Global Citizenship which was held on December 9, 2014.  When I heard rumors of the top 100 travel bloggers being invited to the White House for this prestigious event, I asked to see the list of the Top 100 Travel Bloggers which was not necessarily the same as the White House invitee list. However the Top 100 Travel Bloggers List did not include one Black or African American Travel Blogger. Upon further investigation as to which bloggers of color received an invite to this ground-breaking travel promotion event, it was revealed there were no Black or African American Travel Bloggers invited to this White House Travel Blogger Summit. I stated to the travel blogging community of whom are predominantly white that the list lacked Black People. Their responses were that Black Travel Bloggers lack the statistics and influence of White Travel Bloggers. We did not measure up to their metrics for the Top 100 Travel Bloggers List. Some of the bloggers inquired as to whom should be included on the list this verifying stats. I mentioned some top influential Black Travel Bloggers that I know personally as I don‚Äôt have stats of their readership available. Despite suggestions of possible candidates, not one Black Travel Blogger was present.  The travel blogging community encourages black travel bloggers to keep trying, work harder and maybe next year you will make it. This group also stated that none of the black travel bloggers has the reach level of influence of  Johnny Jet or Nomadic Matt. We pointed out to this travel blogging community that Blacks desire to learn about travel from people who look like them. Traveling while Black is an experience that can only be shared by a Black person. Despite a very heated debated Black Travel Bloggers were snubbed by the travel blogging community  and not invited to the White House Travel Blogger Summit. This is unacceptable from a travel community group of people who are suppose to have a multicultural viewpoint from their travel experiences.

SiswR5OnQuE,Why Travel to Hong Kong? 15 Reasons to Go!,"15 Reasons why you should make Hong Kong your next travel destination!  From the food, to the skyscrapers, the energy, the public transport, and the neon signs, there are tons of reasons to visit Hong Kong!  EXPAND DESCRIPTION FOR MORE!

1 - Skyscrapers
Hong Kong has more skyscrapers than any other city in the world, over 8,000 buildings more than 14 stories
And they are built in crazy places on the side of a big mountain
And it has a really neat night time show every night at 8pm where all the buildings light up to music
Interesting Hi Rise Architecture
Not just boring buildings ‚Äî Feng Shui makes people do interesting things

2. The View
The view from the Peak is Epic
Sky 100
Hong Kong Harbor (from the HK Side, and Kowloon)

3. For the craziness
There are so many people, and so many things going on in such a small space
16,469 people per square mile, and sometimes it feels like the entire population is located in Mongkok. The popular shopping district gained entry into the Guinness Book of World Records as the most crowded shopping district in the world.
What New York City and San Fran Should and could be!
Nice, Clean, Safe
Pedestrian traffic prioritized

4. Food
Dim Sum!  This is the home of Dim Sum!
My favorite is Maxim‚Äôs Palace at City Hall.  The carts have LCD screens!
More Dim Sum!
Roast Goose
Wonton Noodle Soup
Street food in Central and Mongkok
Lot of Michein Starred Restuarants

5. Tea
Chinese restaurants that actually serve food tea!
Often with a candle underneath your teapot to keep it warm
And a separate pot for hot water
Hong Kong Milk Tea

6. Hotels
JW Marriott Hong Kong is one of my favorites anywhere
Conrad Hong Kong
Really great service, but you pay for it!

7. Great public Transportation

Starting with the Airport ‚Äî HKG Airport is really nice
And the Express Train (24 minutes to Central) every 10 minutes
Amazing Subway (MTR)
MTR all has safety doors, don‚Äôt have to worry about getting pushed in
Really nice Double Decker busses
Star Ferry!
And the ding ding!

8. Neon Signs

You like Neon signs?  You‚Äôll love Hong Kong!
Mongkok
Central
Wan Chai

9. For the escalator
Central Mid Levels Escalator is the longest in the world!

10. Big Buddha and the Cable Car

11. Jumbo

12. Day trip to Macau

13. Hong Kong Disneyland

14. Horse Racing
 Twice a week, Wednesday and Sunday at both Happy Valley and Sha Tin

15. Street Markets
Especially if you like to haggle
Temple Street Night Market
Ladies Market
Sham Shui Po (Apliu Electronics Market)
Goldfish Market

bxhPwMNZpgY,Wingmakers Music &amp; Art,"There is something about this artwork and music  that touches one's soul. This particular piece (as with the others found at the Ancient Arrow site) is very busy, almost overwhelming to the eye.  I have tried to break it down for the eye and then put it back together again. The idea behind the paintings is that there is meaning in the symbols and there is communication that is going on at a deeper (subconscious?) level than we may readily perceive with our limited senses. The meaning of this piece is left up to the viewer and that is how it is and should be with all good art /music and myth I might add.  The work, for me, has spiritual meaning, yet if I was asked to tell you what exactly this piece is about, I could not. There is something sensual here to my ears and eyes, a multi-course feast (if you will) that the Creator (James?)  has brought together. This art and music is rumored to be from 'another universe.' It is modified (or somewhat diluted)  from the original because we don't have the same capabilities to perceive it display it and/or recreate it that the beings who created it have developed over eons. For instance, it is said that the pictures move or come alive when viewed in the individual chambers where they were found. Few have witnessed it . It is music and art that supposedly activates long dormant parts of our DNA, DNA that was intentionally genetically manipulated or altered by beings from other parts of the universe many thousands of years ago. Some on earth might have called them ""gods."" This is an ongoing, unfolding project designed by it's creators, the Lyricus teaching order, to open us up to dimensions we have here-to-fore not experienced. I am told we are now on the threshold of being ready for at least part of the information it can impart. The music and art here are from the Ancient Arrow site see: www.wingmakers.com also see www.Lyricus.org.",Art and Music

--------------------

This week i assembled the most gorgeous machined Aluminium Bearing Housings Made by Alexcnc from the MMX Team.
They are adjustable for the Depthing of the gears. We are also implementing the new PBS - Product Breakdown System for the Whole MMX. Chris, the new project manager has introduced me to the sacred lands of Excel heaven and although there is a lot of initial work we have to do to make this function properly, the long term efficiency will improve a lot! We are taking the MMX from being a one off DIY maker project to being a scalable, fully fledged - ready to build for any competent group of people - machine. Its really great! 

Enjoy and have a great day!

d8VA7_qSC7U,With One Voice in Montreal: Art and Music Helping Homeless People.,"""Art to me is a humanitarian act and I believe that there is a responsibility that art should somehow be able to effect mankind, to make the world a better place.""  ~ Jeff Koons

Something I don't talk about very often is that at its very core Invisible People is art. Years ago, my boss at the time had in his office a coffee table book of photos of homeless people. The pictures humanized homeless men, woman, and families as the real people that they are. I said to myself: ""I could do this with video."" Shortly after, I was laid off and Invisible People was started. If you'd like to learn more about my story and how Invisible People started, please watch this documentary https://youtu.be/z0wDn9SAWZs

Art and music have the power to bring people together and change our world for the better. Both art and music can play a huge role in giving homeless people a purpose. Yes, housing ends homelessness but just putting homeless people in boxes will never end homelessness. People need to thrive and not just survive. Art therapy and music therapy are powerful tools for wellness, and as you'll see in this vlog - art, music, and theater can be used for advocacy to help change policy. 

Last year, With One Voice sent a delegation to the ATSA √âtat d'Urgence Festival in Montreal, Canada. It was an amazing few days meeting new friends and brainstorming on how we can help other creative organizations scale to have more impact helping homeless people. I shot a bunch of footage but never got around to editing it into something until this month. My dream is someday to be able to produce mini-documentaries like this vlog highlighting cool ideas and amazing people working to end homelessness who may not always get a lot of media attention.  

For example, in this vlog, I reference a video I shot when I was invited to the Dallas Public Library that you can watch here: https://youtu.be/_SaG0xR7xkU The folks behind With One Voice saw this video and invited Jo and Heather to Montreal to share about creating safe spaces. I hope to one day be able to produce more like this but on a much larger scale! 

In her interview, Beth Knowles from the City of Manchester and With One Voice references the North America Review of Arts and Homelessness that you can find here: http://with-one-voice.com/north-america-country-review

From With One Voice's website: 

With One Voice began as a showcase event curated by Streetwise Opera at the 2012 Cultural Olympiad in London. For the first time in Olympic history, it gave a platform for homeless people ‚Äì celebrating the artistic achievements of 300 performers who had experienced homelessness.

Q&A is a television discussion program that focuses mostly on politics but ranges across all of the big issues that set Australians thinking, talking and debating.

It is driven by interaction: Q&A provides a rare opportunity for Australian citizens to directly question and hold to account politicians and key opinion leaders in a national public forum and Q&A is broadcast live so that not only the studio audience but also the wider audience can get involved.

We aim to create a discussion that is constructive, that reflects a diverse range of views and that provides a safe environment where people can respectfully discuss their differences.

It‚Äôs impossible to represent every view on a single panel or in one audience but we‚Äôre committed to giving participants a fair go.

In order to be as inclusive and diverse as possible, the program is presented from a range of locations around the country and all Australians are encouraged to get involved through social media as well as by joining the audience.

In which John Green teaches you about World War II, aka The Great Patriotic War, aka The Big One. So how did this war happen? And what does it mean? We've all learned the facts about World War II many times over, thanks to repeated classroom coverage, the History channel, and your grandfather (or maybe great-grandfather) showing you that Nazi bayonet he used to keep in his sock drawer and telling you a bunch of age-inappropriate stories about his harrowing war experiences.  So, why did the Axis powers think forceful expansion was a good idea? (they were hungry). So why did this thing shake out in favor of the Allies? HInt: it has to do with the fact that it was a world war.  Germany and Japan made some pretty serious strategic errors, such as invading Russia and attacking the United States, and those errors meant that pretty much the whole world was against them. So, find out how this worldwide alliance came together to stop the Axis expansion. All this, plus Canada finally gets the respectful treatment it deserves. Oh, and a warning: there are a few graphic images in this episode. Sensitive viewers may want to use caution, especially around the 9:15 mark.

European economies were so closely connected that some people expected they have to avoid another world war or destroy their finances, but in fact World War I had taught them how to prepare for just such a scenario. Germany, France, and Great Britain all invested in their military before war broke out. When evaluating these economies to see how war would affect them, we look at four main factors: GDP,  population, territorial extent, and per capita income. Broadly, this helps us determine how resilient, expansive, self-sufficient, and developed a nation is. All of those factors determine how a nation must conduct its war. For example, the vast territorial holdings of the British Empire meant that they had vast resources to draw upon but needed a long time to mobilize them, which helped Germany determine that they needed to strike fast and win big if they hoped to win the war before Britain's full resources came into play. Japan also estimated that they could win a war in the Pacific if they managed to win before the US had been involved for more than 6 months. These calculations drove the early strategies of the Axis powers, but the participation of the US would later prove to be a crucial factor.

Why doesn't this series use the Nazi swastika symbol? James explains: http://bit.ly/1Pzy1k5
____________

Germany's blitzkrieg had been largely successful. France fell early, and Great Britain appeared on the verge of collapse. Europe needed more resources to sustain their resistance, but the United States was bound by the Neutrality Act which established a policy of isolationism and forbade the US from supporting foreign wars in any way. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt skirted those restrictions. He lobbied Congress to reinstate a provision in the law called Cash and Carry, which would allow other nations to buy US war materiel with cash and transport it themselves into the warzone. He also established an agreement which allowed him to place American military bases on British colonies in exchange for destroyer ships, thus safeguarding the far reaches of the United Kingdom from possible Axis invasions. When it turned out that the English won the Battle of Britain and successfully staved off the attempted Nazi conquest, America decided to support them in a more substantial, long term way. Thus the Lend-Lease Act was signed: the US would loan equipment to their strategic partners (who were not the Allies yet). Though supposedly the equipment had to be returned, it was pretty obvious that war materiel would not come back in the same shape if at all, so this was really the largest donation of war supplies ever. But it wound up benefiting the US in turn, since the increased production galvanized an economy that had been stagnant since the Great Depression. It also kickstarted the involvement of the US Merchant Marine, who were among the earliest US citizens to give their lives in World War II and suffered the highest casualty percentage of any branch of the service. These unarmed ships navigated U-boat infested waters to bring much needed supplies to Europe, North Africa, and Asia. Despite this, their service has gone largely unrecognized and unrewarded as they are still denied many veterans' benefits and were not even formally thanked by Congress until 2012.

They met at Haverford College and began a fascinating series of ""Synaesthetic"" collaborations.

1IEHGSLwNmQ,"Yoga of Bass - Workshops on Music, Dance, Art and Spirituality with FreQ Nasty and Claire Thompson","The Yoga of Bass is an ongoing discussion and series of workshops by DJ FreQ Nasty (Darin McFadyen) and Claire Thompson on the intersection of Music, Arts and Spirituality.

Yo-ga [Yoh-guh] ‚Äì a practice or discipline.

Bass [Beys] ‚Äì pertaining to the deepest part of music

Examples include:
anything from a discussion of the Ecstasy of Music, given in a nightclub before we rave out, to a workshop comparing the artistic and creative paths, to a weekend of in-depth teachings on the Yoga Sutras or Buddhist Meditation.

The Yoga of Bass talk specifically, which Darin and Claire have offered in the United States, Canada, England and Australia at yoga studios, art spaces, dance clubs, and festivals including Wanderlust Yoga Festival, Lightning in a Bottle, Symbiosis, and Glade, looks at the parallels between the ecstatic, life-changing experiences people have on the dance floor with music, and the peak states of meditation as experienced on the path of Yoga.

Using personal and musical examples from their lives as DJ, singer, meditation teachers and Yogis alongside explanations from the foundational texts of Yoga and Buddhism, Darin and Claire explore how a yogic and spiritual practice can help you bring this feeling of ecstacy, unity and inter-connectedness off the dance floor and into your life.

Darin McFadyen is music producer and international touring DJ FreQ Nasty. He has remixed and/or collaborated with artists as diverse as Kelis, Santigold, Fatboy Slim, Bassnectar, KRS One, avant classical composer Steve Reich and reggae legend Jnr Delgado. He has been practicing Yoga for 13 years and has studied the great texts of Yoga and Buddhism with Venerable Sumati Marut (www.lamamarut.org). He has also completed a 200-Hour Classics of Yoga Philosophy course with the Yoga Studies Institute (www.yogastudiesinstitute.org) and the 18 Foundational and 18 Advanced courses in Tibetan Buddhism offered by Asian Classics Institute, Los Angeles. Hear his music at: www.FreQNasty.com.

Claire Thompson has been practicing yoga for 7 years and massage therapy for 13 years. She has received the 200-hour Classics of Yoga training through the Yoga Studies Institute, and has completed the 18 Foundational and 18 Advanced courses in Tibetan Buddhism with Venerable Sumati Marut and the Asian Classics Institute (www.acidharma.org). She travels as a yoga, dharma, and meditation teacher.",Art and Music

P2BVyHOdFUo,You Can&#39;t Reheat Some Foods Under Any Circumstances,"Is it safe to microwave your food? Let's imagine you went out to dinner last night. Chances are you brought home the leftovers and they‚Äôre sitting in your fridge right now. But before you break out the styrofoam carton, pop it in the microwave, and chow down, you should know that there are some foods that actually turn poisonous when reheated! 

No matter how tasty and healthy your freshly prepared meal is, it can lose its health benefits and even cause food poisoning if you reheat it in a microwave. Bright Side introduces to you a list of foods that you should eat as soon as they‚Äôre cooked.

SUMMARY:
- Whether they‚Äôre in a soup or stir-fry, reheating mushrooms in the microwave or on the stove is a big no-no. The change in composition can cause you to have an upset stomach, and they also lose their health benefits.
- Similarly to mushrooms, eggs are packed with protein that changes once it‚Äôs reheated. This can wreak havoc on your digestive system. In fact, eggs can become toxic when exposed to a microwave‚Äôs high temperatures.
- Even if the rice is cooked, boiling water won‚Äôt kill the bacteria. After the rice cools off to room temperature, its bacteria spores can multiply, and reheating it just keeps the bacteria alive. The longer it sat at room temperature, the more likely it is to contain harmful bacteria.
- When it‚Äôs time to reheat the breast milk, you should never heat it in a microwave because the uneven distribution of heat can create hot spots in the milk, which can seriously burn the poor baby who drinks it.
- Just like mushrooms, reheating chicken can change the food‚Äôs protein compounds and make you very sick. Unlike other meat (like beef), chicken contains a high amount of protein, which makes reheating it in the microwave a bad idea.
-  If you place cooked potatoes directly into the fridge after cooking them, it‚Äôs probably safe to reheat them. However, if they sit out at room temperature for a while after they‚Äôre prepared, they‚Äôre more likely to develop a rare bacteria known as botulism. 
- While nitrites are dangerous for adults, they‚Äôre incredibly dangerous for infants from 0 to 6 months. If they do ingest food with nitrites, they are more likely to develop ‚Äúblue baby syndrome,‚Äù which can be fatal.
- Before you stick a leftover sandwich in the microwave, don‚Äôt forget to remove any toothpicks the restaurant may have stuck in there! Along with items with sharp tips, metal is a big no-no when it comes to microwave cooking.
