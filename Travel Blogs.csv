AYbJf_wJYcc,13 Travel Tips for INTROVERTS,"Introverts can enjoy travel too!  13 tips to help introverts make the most out of their trips and be comfortable!  I have a secret, and you probably won’t believe it based on what you perceive of me on Youtube, but I’m one of the biggest introverts you’ll ever meet!  When I share this with people I’m told I “hide it very well.”  I can be extremely “outgoing” in bursts, but I need time to recharge.  I don’t think you have to hide being an introvert.  Embrace it, and follow these tips to get more enjoyment out of your introvert travels!

1 - Travel Solo
 Some people just can’t conceive that this is possible, or that anyone would want to do this.  Or that it’s strange, or you’re weird.  Don’t listen to them.  Lots of people do it, and there’s nothing strange about it.

2 - Avoid group tours
 Try Audio Guides instead like Detour, or Rick Steves Europe Walks

3 - But sometimes you might want some group activity
 Maybe a couple hour walking tour
 Or “active” tours, like a cycling tour… can’t talk too much there.
 Or an evening pub crawl
 They are bounded in time, and you can retreat to your “me” space

5 - Stuck with a group?  Make sure you have some downtime scheduled in.
Be up front with them… you need your me time. It’s ok.

6 - Traveling with an extrovert?  It’s OK to do separate things sometimes and then join up
 Be up front with them… you need your me time. You’re not weird.

7 - Noise cancelling headphones are your friends

8 - Restaurants
Bring a book (your travel guide)
Eat early, they won’t mind if you’re taking up a whole table
Sit at the Counter
Go fast casual

9 - Avoid Hostels, Tread carefully with Bed and Breakfasts
 Hostels are party places, and not much alone space
 Research the B&B, make sure they don’t have group breakfasts, and the hosts aren’t too invasive or chatty
Call in advance and explain that you’re looking for a place where you can be alone

10 - Take a camera
 Gives you something to do… you’ve got a mission.  Make a youtube video!

11 - On a long road trip 
Listen to Audio Books

12 - Head in to Nature
take a hike… not many people out there

13 - Know when you’re done
 Know when your social batteries are empty
It’s ok to pass on after dinner drinks, or even dinner itself.
I eat when I’m hungry, I drink when I’m thirsty, and I rest when I’m tired.  I don’t want to get sick.

IhYmWYvqV3I,Why does the Travel Blogging Community NOT Recognize Black Travel Bloggers?,"Why does the Travel Blogging Community NOT Recognize Black Travel Bloggers?

Response to White House Travel Blogger Summit
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeHZvOQJiaY


The White House recently invited travel bloggers to attend the White House Travel Blogger Summit on Study Abroad and Global Citizenship which was held on December 9, 2014.  When I heard rumors of the top 100 travel bloggers being invited to the White House for this prestigious event, I asked to see the list of the Top 100 Travel Bloggers which was not necessarily the same as the White House invitee list. However the Top 100 Travel Bloggers List did not include one Black or African American Travel Blogger. Upon further investigation as to which bloggers of color received an invite to this ground-breaking travel promotion event, it was revealed there were no Black or African American Travel Bloggers invited to this White House Travel Blogger Summit. I stated to the travel blogging community of whom are predominantly white that the list lacked Black People. Their responses were that Black Travel Bloggers lack the statistics and influence of White Travel Bloggers. We did not measure up to their metrics for the Top 100 Travel Bloggers List. Some of the bloggers inquired as to whom should be included on the list this verifying stats. I mentioned some top influential Black Travel Bloggers that I know personally as I don’t have stats of their readership available. Despite suggestions of possible candidates, not one Black Travel Blogger was present.  The travel blogging community encourages black travel bloggers to keep trying, work harder and maybe next year you will make it. This group also stated that none of the black travel bloggers has the reach level of influence of  Johnny Jet or Nomadic Matt. We pointed out to this travel blogging community that Blacks desire to learn about travel from people who look like them. Traveling while Black is an experience that can only be shared by a Black person. Despite a very heated debated Black Travel Bloggers were snubbed by the travel blogging community  and not invited to the White House Travel Blogger Summit. This is unacceptable from a travel community group of people who are suppose to have a multicultural viewpoint from their travel experiences.

BcDFGR2hvNM,11 Things I Love About Traveling to Singapore,"Singapore is one of my favorite travel destinations in the world.  I share with you my top 11 reasons why I love traveling to Singapore.  The producer of Crazy Rich Asians said that movie was his “love letter” to Singapore -- which inspired me to make this video!
EXPAND DESCRIPTION FOR TABLE OF CONTESTS.

1 - The Food!  
Hawker Centres, Food Courts (for A/C), 
Clean, don’t have to worry about getting sick
Laksa, Noodles, Satay, Fruit Juices
Pack of tissue to “chope” a seat

2 - It’s a great Mileage Run!
Regularly $600 round trip from LAX

3- Changi Airport
Butterflies, Koi Fish, Movie Theatre, 3-story slide, 24 hour food courts

4- Singapore Airlines
Satay in Flight -- their lounges are amazing!  Dim Sum!  Singapore Girl dress, since 1972

5- The Gardens
Gardens by the Bay, Cloud Forest Dome, Supertrees, Skywalk, Botanic Garden (1,200 species of orchids, 4.5 million visitors per year)

6- Hotels
Marriott on Orchard Road, Conrad in the CBD

7- Public Transit
MRT is well signposted, easy to navigate and air-conditioned (refuge from hot-steamy weather above), most attractions within walking distance of the MRT.  Polite Passengers, Cheap: 2 day pass is $16, and it’s on time.  Just don’t drink, eat, or bring on a durian!
Taxis are easy to get: 30,000 official taxis servicing a population of fewer than 5.5 million people
8- Urban Hiking
Singapore Southern Ridges Trail -- you’re never far from an MRT

9- Singapore Zoo
I think it’s the best in the world!  

10- Multiculture
combination of Asian and European cultures. Influenced by Malay, South Asian, East Asian, and Eurasian cultures, Singapore has been dubbed as a country where ""East meets West""

Singapore population is 74.2% Chinese, 13.3% Malay, 9.2% Indian and 3.3% other. It’s also the most religiously diverse nation in the world, its population made up of sizable portions of Buddhists, Christians, Muslims and Hindus.

In Singapore's hawker centres, for example, traditionally Malay hawker stalls selling also Tamil food. Chinese stalls may introduce Malay ingredients, cooking techniques or entire dishes into their range of catering.

More than seven in 10 Singaporeans believe personal success is independent of race or ethnicity

11 - Don’t need to pack any winter clothes
Nobody complains about being cold! (well as long as they are outside)

VhefABRqNIg,Planning for travel: How I plan for a trip + Q&amp;A,"I like to travel, but before I can go anywhere I have to plan the journey.  In this LIVE video I share my method for travel planning and tips to hopefully make it easier for you.

Show notes:
Big trip: 3-12 months out

Little trip: 3 weeks prior

First thing: Decide on the destination and roughly the timeframe.

I usually have a ""set"" of destinations in mind. 

Flight considerations:: Flight cost, Flight duration (connections), Airline, Alliance, Class of Service, Revenue or Award

If an award ticket always the saver ticket, usually business class.  Make sure to check other airlines website for availability and CALL.  Partner airlines almost always have the best availability.

Award tickets: Think of creative routings, look at an airline route map, SAN to NRT on JAL, LAX to VIE on Austrian

United miles: At least 3 cents per mile

If booking on short notice what seats are available?  Exit row economy plus?

What are the ontime statistics for the flight?  Tip: Early morning flights are the most ontime.  High revenue flights also most ontime.

Might I be changing the flights quite a bit?  Then Southwest -- no change fees.

Tools I use: Kayak, Google Flights, ITA Matrix, Airline Websites (actual and partner), and calling the airline.

Use month long views, flexible dates, pick some random specific dates and write down the best ones.

Picking a hotel:
Start with TripAdvisor
Read FlyerTalk threads
Look for blog reviews on the hotel

I like Marriott&Sheraton, Hyatt, Hilton (in that order).  Best Western and Holiday Inn basically don't exist for me.  Radisson nice internationally.

I tend towards large business hotels, but also like the boutique mini chains, Autograph Collection and Andaz.

I avoid domestic Courtyards like the plague.

Factors for hotel decision: Cost, Quiet rooms, Good AC, Good Location (public transport), Good and cheap (free?) Breakfast, Lounge access, close to restaurants & grocery store.

For big chain hotels I always book thru the hotel website.  For international trips often Expedia.  For Japan: Rakuten.

Tip:. Check special hotel rates: AAA, Senior, other?

Some hotels have bizarre minimum stay requirements (Andaz Maui I'm talking about you!)

I almost always book refundable and changeable hotel reservations.

If I don't know specific cities yet, I'll start with a full booking at arrival airport city and shorten reservation later.

Buy a few travel books -- Rick Steves for Europe.  Select from the most popular on Amazon.

Watch YouTube videos.  Read wikitravel,
Look for other people's itinerary for similar trip length.

Develop general itinerary in Google Docs.  Also Google keep. Detailed down to what city per day and where we sleep.  What mode of transport? Car, train, plane?

Generally at least 2 nights in a hotel, prefer 3.  Generally prefer trains, then car, then planes

Make new hotel bookings or change if new destinations.  Check prices of existing reservations.

A month out: Book train tickets or buy rail passes.  Print out ideal train times.  Determine airport to hotel transportation.  Print out major attraction info.

Right before I go: Check the weather -- Make sure I've packed appropriately.  Also be on the lookout for possible weather delays.  Change flights if Weather Advisory allows.  Check hotel prices again, change to non refundable if available.  Make sure I have enough money in my ATM card account.  Download Google maps offline.

Night before: Decide which travel buddies are going..  Finish final packing of luggage.

ZU8ji-yi5Zk,How to Travel Cheap to Japan: 10 Money Saving Tips,"10 tips on how to travel to Japan without breaking your wallet! Many people think Japan is an expensive destination, but that is totally not true!  It is very easy to travel to Japan for cheap.  Tips include: Cheap flights to Japan, cheap trains in Japan, and of course: Cheap Eats in Japan.  So how cheap am I talking about? Staying in a hostel, buying a rail pass, eating relatively cheap food, and visiting a few attractions will cost around $100 USD per day

1 - Travel off peak: Cherry blossom and autumn foliage times (usually around early April and mid-November, respectively) are peak season for Japanese travelers, meaning peak hotel rates.  Watch out for Japan-Only Holidays: Golden Week and Obon (April 29 to May 5 and around mid-August, respectively

2 - Airports:  Fly in to some place other than Tokyo.  Osaka -- flights to Osaka are often $200 cheaper than flights to Tokyo.  And it’s right next to Kyoto.  And go to Nara to feed the deer!  Nagoya (home of Toyota) often has really cheap flights too (Like $450/round trip)

3 - Getting to the city from the airport: Don’t take a taxi.  It can be like $200 from Narita to Tokyo.  Take a Limousine bus or NEX for about 3,000 Yen, or the Keisei Line from Narita for about 1300 Yen (slower equals cheaper).  Buy a combination ticket, NEX plus Suica card.  Similar combos in Osaka.

4- Getting around
Tokyo subways starts at 160 Yen, or about $1.50 US.  Many cities often sell day passes for 600-1000 Yen.

JR Pass: 7-Day is 29,110 Yen.  Good for Tokyo to Kyoto/Osaka round trip.  Osaka to Tokyo each way is about 14,000 Yen.  Buy online before you go, save about 20%.

Look for local JR Passes for a particular region or special offers like the Seishun 18 for only 11,850 for 5 days.  Seishun 18 allows unlimited rides on local and rapid JR trains (excluding reserved seats) throughout Japan from Hokkaido in the north to Kyushu in the south. Although the Seishun 18 is not valid on Shinkansens and limited express trains, it is a great way to enjoy travel at a more leisurely pace. This ticket package includes five days worth of travel for only 2,370 yen per day. One person can enjoy the Seishun 18 for five days, or it can be split for use by up to five people.

Get the Kansai Through Pass if you are in Osaka/Kyoto, 5,200 yen for 3 days unlimited transit.

5-Bus
Long distance buses: Overnight buses will be slower than the Shinkansen, but can save quite a bit.  Particularly if you can sleep on them.  Tokyo to Osaka by bus is 10 hours, and 4,500 Yen.  

Willer Express Bus offers a ¥10,000 3-trip pass and a ¥15,000 5-trip pass (~$100 and $150 USD respectively). These 3 and 5 travel trips (referred to as “days” on the site) can be used anytime, non-consecutively within a 2-month window

6 - Bicycle:  Many cities have metropolitan bike rental programs.  Takamatsu city rents bikes for 200 yen per day!  2,000 yen for a whole month.


7 - Shopping
Tax-Free Shopping: 8% refund for purchases over 5,000 yen at the same store.  Refund at the store.

100 Yen Shops: Like Daiso. Cheap gifts!

8 - Hotels:  
Business Hotels (Toyoko Inn, 7,500 Yen a night in Shinjuku)
[Stay more nights get a discount]
[Book in advance get a discount]
Capsule Hotels (3,000 Yen for a night, sometimes only men)
Hostels (2,000 a night -- but maybe free if you clean for a few hours)
Love Hotels (8000 Yen a night.. Stay at a business hotel instead)
Manga Cafes (100 yen for 30 minutes, 900-1500 yen for three hours and 1,600-3,000 yen for 7- to 12-hour packages)
Mcdonalds (the price of a meal)

Onsen/Hotspring:  Use a public bathhouse -- Often 500 Yen.

9 - Food:  Watch my cheap eats in Tokyo video.  Osaka Ohsho for Gyoza.  Yoshinoya for beef bowls.  Mos Burger for burgers.  Sushi at rotating sushi places.

Visit high-end restaurants at lunch for lunch specials.  No tipping.

10 - Attractions:  Multi-attraction passes, sometimes combined with transportation cost
Visit temples for free
Rooftop observation decks (Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building in Shinjuku)

Bonus: Money Exchange: At an ATM -- 7-11.

PdtliDrPYYA,25 Worst TRAVEL MISTAKES and How to Avoid Them,"Travel is fun, but can be frustrating if you make too many mistakes.  Here are the top 25 travel mistakes I see travelers make these days and HOW to avoid them.  Learn from my and other people's mistakes and enjoy more stress-free relaxing travel!

1 - Having too full of an itinerary
 Part of travel is exploring.  You should have some slack time in your agenda

2 - Underestimating travel/train times
 It’s no fun spending ALL DAY on trains/planes/automobiles and not actually seeing anything

3 - Overpacking
 You don’t need your whole house!
 Just weighs you down.
 If you can just bring a carryon that’s the best!
 Need room for stuff you buy too

4 - Underpacking
 Shorts and t-shirt weather?  
Might be good to have at least one pair of pants, and long sleeves

5 - Impossibly short connections
 If the airline let me book it, it must be OK right????
 Arriving in to LHR and departing from LGW, or (NRT, HND)

6 - Booking separate tickets as a connection
 If the flights aren’t in the same PNR, you are usually out of luck
 
7 - Not realizing that a “direct” flight is not the same as a non-stop
 Why does my “direct” flight from LA to New York take 9 hours?

8 - Not paying attention to all the fees -- Booking Spirit Airlines
Up to $65 to carry-on a bag if paid at the gate

9 - Booking Afternoon departure flights
The most “on-time” flights are generally first thing in the morning.  Afternoon flights have to arrive from some place, which can lead to delays.  
East coast thunderstorms.
 
10 - Booking flights that arrive in the dead of night
 Yes, the flight might be cheaper.  Good luck getting transport in to the city.

11 - Not selecting a seat ahead of time
 If it’s possible to select a seat, do it.  
If you don’t select a seat then you might not actually be flying on that plane.
 Or do you like the last row next to the toilet?

12 - Not checking visa requirements before you get to the airport
 No fun to get turned away at the airline counter because of no Visa
 Your passport should be valid too!  Needs at least 6 months validity.

13 - Not checking in online
 If the plane is weight limited, and you are last to checkin, too bad for you.

14 - Not getting money at the airport
Hunting for that perfect currency exchange place to save $10 isn’t worth it.  
Just use the airport ATM and have some cash when you hit the city.  
Don’t expect the taxi to take credit cards either.

15 - Taking the airport share-ride shuttle
 This is the worst $20 you’ll ever save for wasting 90 minutes of your life.
 Don’t save money at the expense of time.  How much did you pay for those flights?

16 - Not checking hotel prices before you book your flights
 Cheap flights to Tokyo in April?  Because the hotels are $1,000 a night!

17 - Booking hotels in the middle of nowhere to save $10
 Spending $20 extra on transportation, and 60 minutes each way to the city

18 - Not paying attention to flights across the date line, or the red eye
 Make sure your hotel is booked for the actual day you arrive. 
Not the day before, or after.

19 - Not signing up for rewards programs (Airlines, Hotels, Rental Cars)
You’re throwing money down the drain.
   
20 - Not getting an international data plan, or a foreign sim card
 Then realizing you’re getting charged some exorbitant amount

21 - Not printing out your travel/reservation details
 Phone battery dead?  Wifi doesn’t work?  Paper always does!

22 - Wearing lousy footwear
 Nothing worse than a nice big blister to start your trip on the first day
 Good socks too!

23 - Not paying attention to the thieves that are paying attention to you
 Pickpockets love tourists.  Don’t be a victim!  Be sharp!
 Don’t be overly trusting
 Scam artists love tourists.  
Random dude at the airport with a taxi might not be that honest
Offer to take you photo, and take your camera
Gypsies love to “help” you with subway ticket machines

24 - Never leaving the tourist areas

25 - Only eating familiar foods

26 - Getting bummed out over delays/cancellations/bad weather

27 - Not putting down the camera

28 - Not watching Yellow Productions Before you Go!

JSlluO_noAs,15 Worst Travel Pet Peeves,"Seeing the world is amazing, but sometimes the journey can be really annoying!  I share my list of the top 15 WORST things that annoy me about traveling.  These things really bug me!  EXPAND DESCRIPTION FOR TABLE OF CONTENTS.  I’ll start by talking about pet peeves at airports, then annoyances from planes, hotels, transportation, and finally just out and about at a destination.  This idea came from Yellow Productions subscriber socalseth!  Thanks Seth for the idea, and some of the starter annoyances!

-- Airports --
1 - Security Check
= People trying to sneak things thru tsa
= Or the person that tries to go thru tsa with the Mr T starter set worth of jewelry
= Passengers who neglect to push their luggage through the TSA scanner
= TSA in general -- smile more dudes
= CBP at passport control -- I’m not a terrorist -- how about a welcome home?
= Security announcements about not leaving bags unattended -- I know already!
= When the Pre Check line is longer than the regular line
2 - Lines
= When the elite line is longer than the regular line
= People who pretend the line doesn’t apply to them
= Gate “lice” -- Oh.. I’m not in boarding group 1?
= Standing right next to the baggage claim belt
3 - Check in
= Self check-in machines that don’t work
= Airlines that don’t open check-in until 2 hours before

4 - Airport shops
= $4 extortion priced water -- In japan they have water check machines
= Airport food
= Airline lounges that are “full”
5 - Delays
Flights that are delayed endlessly -- if my plane isn’t here and it’s departure time, maybe you should announce a delay

-- Planes --
6 - Odor
= too much perfume (Seth)
= body odor is terrible -- in general odor, and feet
= Bringing Smelly food on the plane
7 - Lack of etiquette
= Rudeness 
= parents that don't manage their kids well
= obviously had too much to drink
= Arm rest hog
= Full seat recline immediately without looking
= Dressing like nobody else is on the plane with you
8 - Boarding and deplaning
= Bringing too much stuff on the plane
= Not being ready
= Unpacking their whole suitcase on the plane
= Asking me to switch seats
= Exit row by row

-- Hotels --
9 - Front Desk
= The check-in line that never ends
= Check out is at 11am when you checked in at 1am
10 - Fees
= Resort fees
= Parking fees (If I pay, the valet should be FAST!)
= Wifi Fees (If I pay, the wifi should be BLAZING! And 2 devices???)
11 - Rooms
Noisy A/C -- particularly inconsistent
Rooms that are too hot
Ticking clocks
Dripping sinks
things you hear thru thin hotel walls!
Doors that slam (and people who slam them)
Or when you hear elephants walking upstairs
Loud people in hallways
Or trains through windows



-- Transportation --
12- Rental Cars 
= Shuttles that are hot and stuffy
= Rental Car: The upsell on everything
= Bad car smell in general, and of smoke
= Dirty windshields, mirrors
= Headlights that don’t work (yes, this has happened to me)
= Trunks that are full of water (yes, this too)
= Parking meters that only take coins.  It’s 2018 already!
13 - Trains and Subway
= Trains that are late!
= NYC Subway entrances for a certain direction
= Subway: People who can’t wait for you to get off before they get on

14 - Out and about:
Selfie sticks
Pictures with Ipads
VIdeo with ipad

15 - Rudeness
= People who feel they are “super special” -- “Do you know who I am?”
Travel Forums
Leaving trash everywhere.  Pick up your crap!
Ugly Americans

And finally just because I really hate FEES:
Hidden Fees for everything!
Baggage fees, Resorts fees, etc, etc, etc!

→ Who are we? 

Hey there! We are Greg and Hillary – a husband and wife team that loves traveling, going on adventures, and helping others do the same! Although we love traveling, at this point in time, we still have full time 9-5 jobs in Dallas, Texas.
In August of 2016, we packed up our things, Greg quit his job, and we moved to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico! 
Hillary is working remotely for her CPA firm and Greg is working on this site full time. 
We view ourselves as fairly ordinary people, complete with an ordinary income, ordinary jobs, and (unfortunately) an ordinary amount of student loan debt (thanks UNT!).
I know what you are thinking, “Aren’t travel blogs supposed to be written by hippies that don’t have jobs and live in hostels?!” Well don’t you worry, we are working on making that happen! Although we hope to become full time travelers in the next 1-2 years, this site is not necessarily aimed at people that want to travel full time.
Our hope is not that you quit your job and become a long haired, bearded, Volkswagen van driving hippy. Instead, our hope is that after reading our stories you are more inspired to live a more fulfilling life from 5pm-9am!
Why such the emphasis on how ordinary we are? Although we love reading travel blogs, it is easy to feel disconnected from the writers at times. It seems as though they are leading such extraordinary lives that they are somehow doing something that is unreachable to the “average” person.  

We are here to prove that wrong. We are here to tell you that even if you work a full-time job and only get two weeks of vacation each year-you still have the power to design an adventurous life for yourself. Afterall, that is exactly where we started before leaving it all behind to live la vida loca! 
After having several caffeine induced conversations about how people should travel more and shift their priorities in a way that will lead to a more fulfilling life, we decided to share our stories with you.
Our purpose in creating Kinetic Kennons is to share our stories of travels, adventures, and funny mishaps and to inspire others to design a life full of exploration. Throughout this site you will find posts about how to go on a cheap weekend trip, funny stories such as the time Hillary forgot to update her passport before an international trip, and inspirational rants on why you should lead a more adventurous life!",Travel
#NAME?,How To Make Travel Videos That People Actually Watch,"10 tips for how to make travel videos that are fun, informative, and entertaining.  I often get asked how I make my travel videos, and I’ll be sharing my process.  I’ll start with ideas, research, writing the script, filming, to ultimately editing and putting the video on Youtube.  No discussion of drone shots here! Follow Yellow Productions on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/yellowwproductions/

1 - Coming up with an idea
 Starts with a trip — where am I going?  What other videos have I made?  Whats interesting at this destination?  What else have people already done?
 I have some “classic” themes, 10 things to know, cheap eats, how to ride public transit

 If its an idea for a live stream — then its something I can talk about for an hour, and hopefully something that encourages dialogue.

2 - Research
 To make an informative travel guide (or even just have a good trip) requires research.  Youtube, Wikitravel, Blogs, trip advisor, Flyertalk, and even books.  Rick Steves are my favorite for Europe.  I put this all in to a few documents in Google Drive/Google Docs.

3 - Writing the “script”
 Nobody wants to watch a constant stream of consciousness…  it has to be a story.  So this is where some more “thinking” comes in, as to how to weave whatever in to an interesting story, with a beginning, middle, and end.  Even if it’s “10 cheap eats” or “10 things to know” — there has to be an order to those things.

 Usually a bulleted list of notes.

 Destinations I’ll put the name, address, “neighborhood”, Subway stop, website link.  Sometimes pictures.

 The things I really want to go to, I put in to Google Maps as a “star” or a “heart”

4 - Preparing equipment for the video

 Camera, Batteries, More Batteries, Microphone, Lens Cleaner

 2nd Camera?  Go Pro?  360 Camera?  External Audio Recorder?  Lights?
 
 Tripod, Gorillapod, Selfie Stick

5 - Prepping to roll on scene

 Not always in order that you see it.  And often not a flow in the same video. Might shoot one clip of one video, and another clip of another video back to back.

 Review my notes before the scene.

 Find a good angle where you can see me, and whatever I’m talking about, not noisy, OK lighting, won’t bug too many people, where can I put my tripod?  Where won’t security hassle me.

 Is the sun bad?  Might have to come back at a different time of day

6 - Shooting the main scene

 Lights, Camera, Action!

 I try to pretend it’s a conversation, just with a piece of glass instead of a real person.

 Often requires multiple takes.  Might even redo the same blurb in different locations.  Make sure audio was capture, and that it is understandable

 Standing shots, Walking Shots, Walk on to the shot, Walk off the shot, Intros, Conclusions

 Always make sure to get a few extra seconds of video at the beginning and at the end

7 - Shooting B Roll

 This is the stuff I insert on top of me talking so it’s not always me.

 Steady shots.  Pan shots.  Time lapse shots.  Something that would be interesting.  I always capture WAY more B-Roll than I use.  

 Sometimes this has to be as a picture, because pulling out my camcorder would be too noticeable.

8 - Downloading the video

 So I come home, I transfer all the video off my camera, phone, etc.  To 2 different computers that way I’ve always got a backup.

 I generally use Sony/Magix Vegas for Windows.  Or Final Cut Pro for mac if I’m traveling

 Then I categorize all the video shot in to groups: topics/destinations, what video it will be in, scenic shots (B roll). Delete the stuff that just isn’t good.  

9 - Let the editing begin!


10 - Render and upload

SiswR5OnQuE,Why Travel to Hong Kong? 15 Reasons to Go!,"15 Reasons why you should make Hong Kong your next travel destination!  From the food, to the skyscrapers, the energy, the public transport, and the neon signs, there are tons of reasons to visit Hong Kong!  EXPAND DESCRIPTION FOR MORE!

1 - Skyscrapers
Hong Kong has more skyscrapers than any other city in the world, over 8,000 buildings more than 14 stories
And they are built in crazy places on the side of a big mountain
And it has a really neat night time show every night at 8pm where all the buildings light up to music
Interesting Hi Rise Architecture
Not just boring buildings — Feng Shui makes people do interesting things

2. The View
The view from the Peak is Epic
Sky 100
Hong Kong Harbor (from the HK Side, and Kowloon)

3. For the craziness
There are so many people, and so many things going on in such a small space
16,469 people per square mile, and sometimes it feels like the entire population is located in Mongkok. The popular shopping district gained entry into the Guinness Book of World Records as the most crowded shopping district in the world.
What New York City and San Fran Should and could be!
Nice, Clean, Safe
Pedestrian traffic prioritized

4. Food
Dim Sum!  This is the home of Dim Sum!
My favorite is Maxim’s Palace at City Hall.  The carts have LCD screens!
More Dim Sum!
Roast Goose
Wonton Noodle Soup
Street food in Central and Mongkok
Lot of Michein Starred Restuarants

5. Tea
Chinese restaurants that actually serve food tea!
Often with a candle underneath your teapot to keep it warm
And a separate pot for hot water
Hong Kong Milk Tea

6. Hotels
JW Marriott Hong Kong is one of my favorites anywhere
Conrad Hong Kong
Really great service, but you pay for it!

7. Great public Transportation

Starting with the Airport — HKG Airport is really nice
And the Express Train (24 minutes to Central) every 10 minutes
Amazing Subway (MTR)
MTR all has safety doors, don’t have to worry about getting pushed in
Really nice Double Decker busses
Star Ferry!
And the ding ding!

8. Neon Signs

You like Neon signs?  You’ll love Hong Kong!
Mongkok
Central
Wan Chai

9. For the escalator
Central Mid Levels Escalator is the longest in the world!

10. Big Buddha and the Cable Car

11. Jumbo

12. Day trip to Macau

13. Hong Kong Disneyland

14. Horse Racing
 Twice a week, Wednesday and Sunday at both Happy Valley and Sha Tin

15. Street Markets
Especially if you like to haggle
Temple Street Night Market
Ladies Market
Sham Shui Po (Apliu Electronics Market)
Goldfish Market

Zd7AqJRXaaE,We&#39;re Back! Our Trip Through The Blizzard In Our New RV,"In this Ask Us Anything, we share the new RV we'll be riding in for the next month or so - the Wonder RTB (for Rear Twin Beds) model from Leisure Travel Vans.

Jennifer and I visited the factory in Winkler, Manitoba last week and returned to our Michigan home in a borrowed Wonder RTB, a 2019 Class B+ coach that is build on the Ford Transit Chassis.

It's the first time we have driven a B+ (which is technically a Class C RV) and it's a first for driving the Ford Transit, which is increasingly becoming a popular chassis choice for RV manufacturers. We'll drive it to Florida this week and then out to Salt Lake City to attend the RVx industry trade show, where we will return it to Leisure Travel Vans. 

I'll do reviews on the Wonder and how the Ford Transit performs as an RV chassis as we get more experience with both.

We'll have a full video Thursday of a tour we had of the LTV factory up there in Winkler. But below is a rewind of last night's live stream in which we answered lots of audience questions and shared our experience of driving home in a blizzard and our new partnership with the folks at Leisure Travel Vans.

wKA4g97ojNg,Travel Coffee Break (#tcbhoa) Thu 23 May 2013 - No. 70,"For this edition I was joined by SEO expert Ralph du Plessis from Red Mud Media, Ron Mader (in Mexico) from Planeta.com and travel writer, Ian Redmayne (Irresponsible Traveller).  There were several others who tried to join but seemed to have tech issues (disable Skype before installing the Google video messaging app needed for Hangouts).

The plan had been to discuss some of the threads and trends from last week's Travel Bloggers Unite - Europe conference in Rotterdam, attended by around 150 bloggers, plus PRs, tourism and travel industry representatives.

I did talk about some of those things (01:50), but we didn't have anyone from the conference.

I talked about the (03:45)expansion of the family - how events like TBU are opening up to other lifestyle bloggers, eg parent bloggers and fashion bloggers and the (05:16) survey of travellers and travel bloggers conducted and prsented by Gary Bembridge which demonsrates a gap between what travellers want from travel blogs and what travel bloggers think their readers want.

(09:10) Ron suggested that in some ways a wiki is a better way to post useful, up-to-date info than a blog.

(19:40) We talked about how the survey figures and ongoing topic thread in conference sessions, suggested that bloggers need to provide more factbox style useful info for their readers.

(21:55) Nick talked about practical info in guidebooks such as Bradt guides.

(41:08) I talked about how there has been a step-change in monetization for bloggers, with pro-bloggers being much more commercially adept, and creating social media marketing campaigns for tourism and travel organisations, through blogger marketing/publisher groups like iAmbassadors and Navigate Media.

(46:11) We talked about the ongoing relationship between bloggers and destination marketing organisations (DMOs) and brand advocacy.

(53:18)Ralph talked about the latest SEO developments and how it affects bloggers.

ol1moDMzNYE,Top 10 Best Credit Cards for Travel in 2018,"The best credit cards for travelling in 2018.  These cards are the best either for their generous signup bonus, rewards for spending on the card, or the ongoing benefits just for having the card.  Some have a high annual fee, and some have none.  I’ve got some plain cash back cards, and even a debit card at the end.  I’ll conclude with the list of the other cards that I carry in my wallet that didn’t make the top 10.

Signup bonus. But maybe after you get the signup bonus the card should just go on the shelf

Digital Nomad Jobs allow you to get paid while you travel and are a great way to start a location independent lifestyle. Travel jobs are listed in a number of different places like CoolJobs.com, ResortJobs.com etc.

""Getting Paid to Travel"" happens usually in 2 different ways. You either find Digital Nomad jobs or you start an online business that will keep you afloat for years to come while you can move around freely and live in different countries anytime you wish.

This video covers Travel jobs and a first introduction into location independent Business models.

How about working on a cruise ship or yacht? - it is a great way to see the world with a good salary and minimal expenses since room and board are paid. There are a multitude of different Digital Nomad job types available that allow you to get paid to travel from general hospitality and management all the way to tour guide and entertainer. 

Since applying for cruise ship jobs is a very competitive process, learning the most efficient way to apply - the how and where - will save you years of frustration. 

HOW TO WORK ON A CRUISE SHIP
An excellent course - ""How to Work on a Cruise Ship"" - can be found here: http://sassyzengirl.com/Work-on-Cruise-Ship
created by someone who has successfully done it for years and is considered the top priority in this field. 

Another popular form of Location Independent jobs are National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries. Unless you have special skills or a degree in animal care, agriculture, forestry, marine biology etc., the best way to get in is to volunteer. 

Simply google the country you want to visit and ""National Parks Volunteer programs"" or ""Wildlife Sanctuary Volunteer Program"" and start submitting applications. If it works out well, chances are good that you might be offered a more permanent (paid) position or that the park/sanctuary managers might recommend you to another job opportunity in the field.

Another large area of jobs for Digital Nomads is teaching - both abroad and online. Online teaching gives you greater freedom and flexibility while teaching abroad usually offers better pay and immersion into the local culture.

English is the most popular form of international teaching or online teaching, but any language can work and so can a lot of other skills. Simply visit pages like Instaedu or skillshare, udemy to see what's out there already and in particular, what is selling well, e.g. what people actually want to learn (=much easier to make money at....;-)

Finally, working in resorts, hotels, hostels for a while can be a fun and lucrative way to get paid to travel and land Digital Nomad Jobs while meeting people from all around the world. 

The website resortjobs.com gives a wide range of listings and you can also google the country of your choice + resort jobs etc.

5-XDh6XInUk,Airline Miles Basics: 15 Things to Know To Earn More Miles,"Things YOU need to know to maximize the amount of airline miles you earn.  I explain Airline rewards programs that can often be confusing and complicated.  Don’t let your airline miles go to waste, they are yours.. you earned them!  Well.. as long as you put in your frequent flyer number!

1 - Why earn miles?
Simple.. free flights! Or upgrades!
If you dont like to travel, you are probably in the wrong place
People often ask me how I can afford to travel so much.
Simple answer: miles

2 - How do you earn them?
Flying
Credit cards
Shopping portals
Rental Cars
Partner deals
When the airline makes a mistake
Transfer in

3 - Revenue based vs distance based
These programs started based on distance
But now are typically somehow based on revenue.  
Usually a complicated formula based on dollars spent,  class of service, elite status, and maybe distance flown

4 - What about elite qualifying miles?
These are earned typically in a calendar year to qualify for a certain tier.  Elite miles reset annually and can't be “redeemed” for anything. 

5 - Redemptions for anything else besides travel is a bad deal

6 - Not all miles and points are equal
Every airline has it's own award chart, United miles generally more valuable than Delta Skymiles
Surcharges can sometimes be crazy
Having a transferable currency is more valuable because of transfer options

7 - Premium class travel gets you the best redemption value
Often best on that airlines metal, other carriers may cost more.
Upgrades can sometimes be worthwhile if the copay is reasonable
Avoid British Airways

8 - Not all award options are online
Often have to call the airline to book

9 - Sign up for a rewards program even if you are only going to take 1 flight with the airline
Never know, it could be more.  Or that's at least a free magazine subscription 

10 - Focus or diversify?
Focus on one program in each alliance.
Star Alliance
One World
Sky Team
You can credit miles from one airline to your account with a different carrier in the same alliance.  Pay attention to the fare class. 

11 - Miles expire
Use something like awardwallet, or a spreadsheet to track them

12 - Mileage Run
Going the furthest for the cheapest price
Doesn't work on revenue based programs

13 - Credit Cards
My favorite way to earn
Ultimate Rewards are my favorite reward currency 
3 points on Chase Sapphire Reserve for travel

14 - Shopping Portals
Every airline has one
Look for the best earning portal
Usually a percentage of purchase price
But sometimes bonus lump sums

15 - Booking tips  
Award availability is typically not all seats
Sometimes the best awards are booked last minute
Or 365 days out.

NuMlIP8yuWc,Travel Photography Tips For Beginners: Room For Travel Hangout On Air,"The Room For Travel bloggers got together and had a Live Hangout about great travel photography tips for beginners.

OudIK1RvrAA,Travel Coffee Break #19 Thu 13 Dec 2012 (#tcbhoa),"This edition of #tcbhoa was 'open forum' - there was no scheduled topic.

I was joined from Sweden by travel writer/blogger/photographer Lola Akinmade Akerstrom and later from the USA by Tichawanda Darangwa.

Lola and I talked about the varied nature of her work and how multi-role work-styles are the norm for professional freelance travel writers/bloggers these days. Lola works for Visit Sweden through the Swedish Institute which runs the official website for Sweden, www.sweden.se. She also described her work as a photographer and as a speaker/presenter at blogger and social media conferences. We talked through several examples of bloggers creating innovative new publications and revenue streams, such as: Nellie Huang's WildJunket magazine, Kash Bhattacharya's Luxury Hostels of Europe project, the blogger's collaborative Traveller's Handbook series, and Gary Arndt's branded photographic tour.  Lola also spoke about the need for bloggers to connect and build relationships with their local tourist boards.

We were joined by Tichawanda Darangwa aka 'Tich' who has built a business paying bloggers - not just travel bloggers - to run email marketing campaigns to their subscribers. He explained how it can be a much more efficient sales driver than traditional banner advertising, link selling or affiliate advertising. He doesn't have a website but you can Google for 'Tich the great' to find him.

NdzIwuC74Oo,Travel Planning: Upgrades Every Family Should Splurge On - Top Flight Family - Luxury Family Travel,"Travel planning is essential when traveling with kids, but so is planning which upgrades you're going to splurge on. Family travel isn't easy, so the more you can save time and travel in comfort, the more enjoyable your family vacation will be. In this live video, I talk about travel planning when it comes to upgrading your travel. Which upgrades are most worthwhile for families? Which are not? From TSA Pre-check and Global Entry to first class travel, from VIP arrival services at the airport to first class airport lounges, from suites and villas to club-level accommodations, I'll talk about which upgrades are essential when you travel with kids. With just a little extra travel planning, your next family trip will be amazing!

EJCtVohc9BE,Travel Coffee Break (#tcbhoa) Mon 07 Jan 2013 - #26 (open forum),"This edition of the Travel Coffee Break was 'Open Forum'. I was joined by travel bloggers Dylan Lowe (in Kula Lumpur) and Keith Jenkins.

We talked about iAmbassador blog trips, and Blogmanay in particular, where 21 bloggers were invited to Edinburgh for Hogmanay and then on a tour of Scotland. This morning there was an article about Blogmanay in the Scotsman. We talked about the way commercial/paid-for blog trip projects like this and the upcoming Finland Blogsposure are developing, and about the changing relationship between tourism organisations and travel writers (bloggers). We talked about Return on Investment and the new ROI online calculator tool developed by Keith and Melvin Boecher (Traveldudes). We talked about how the travel industry finds bloggers to work with and how groups and organisations like TBU and the Professional Travel Bloggers Association are developing databases to make that easier. We talked about the expanding range of bloggers being used by tourism organisations and DMOs - no longer just travel bloggers, but mom bloggers, fashion bloggers, food & wine bloggers too.

We talked about Keith's recent TEDx talk and Dylan's travel plans in Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore and Cambodia, and about his new 360 food blog. And we talked about the increasing work demands on bloggers that new projects create and how to deal with that by sharing the workload, taking on extra help, or just creating more office time while travelling.

pFIk7QyJIhU,Travel Vocabulary: Frequent Flyer Lingo,"The world of travel has an interesting vocabulary.  There are lots of terms like what is a “Direct” flight vs a “Non-Stop” flight that often confuse travelers!  In this video I’ll explain 20 frequently used travel terms and what the meaning of each phrase is. ------- EXPAND DESCRIPTION for Table of Contents. --------
 
1- Direct vs Non Stop
 
2- Thru Passenger;   Passenger on a direct flight that isnt getting off at the stopping point
 
3- Connection - Domestic less than 4 hours, International less than 24 hours
 
4- Illegal Connection - minimum connect time too short
 
5- Stop Over: stay in a connection city for greater than 24 hours and less than the duration of your trip
 
6- Airline Alliance: Star Alliance, SkyTeam,  and Oneworld
 
7- Long Haul Flight (Ultra Long Haul): - Considerable time, distance, and Jet lag
 
8- Short Haul: Opposite of Long Haul: Most low cost carriers fly here
 
9- Open Jaw - Depart from a different airport than the one landed in.
The open jaw needs to be within the same region (which is defined by each airline’s program).
The unflown segment needs to be shorter than the distance of the flown segments.
 
10 - Split ticketing:  Round trip made of two one way tickets
 
11 - Red-Eye flight:  Typically an overnight flight.  Your eyes will be red cause you're tired
 
12 - Irregular Operations: Weather delays, flight cancel, equipment change
 
13 - Bump: VDB and IVDB
 
14 - SSSS - Selected for Secondary Security Screening
 
15 - Mileage Run
 
16- CPM - Cents per mile
 
17- Hard Product:  Physical offering like planes
 
18- Soft Product - customer service, boarding, flight attendants, food, etc
 
19- Miles: Actual Miles, Premier/Elite Miles, Award Miles
 
20- FOC: Dreaded Disease..  Fear of Coach!

aLnchZU6w54,Travel Coffee Break (#tcbhoa) Weds 20 Feb 2013 - #42,"This edition was 'Open Forum', however there were some topics which we settled on before the start.

My guests were: Oliver Gradwell from Travel Bloggers Unite; Gary Bembridge, Marketer/blogger/podcaster from Gary Bembridge Unleashed; Vago Damitio from Vagobond.com; Simon Veness, travel writer from Venesstravelmedia.com; and Ralph du Plessis from SEO firm Red Mud Media.

Carly Morson, Publishing Manager at Red Mud, was also with us in spirit at least - her mic & webcam weren't working.

The opening topic was Google+ itself and its benefits to bloggers. This topic had originated in a G+ post from travel blogger, Cole Burmester (Four Jandals) admitting he wasn't sure he was using G+ to maximum advantage, and didn't fully understand the significance of meta attributes 'rel author' and 'rel publisher'. It was suggested that we talk it through on Travel Coffee Break.

QElSrzD9eaI,Selling Travel on Social,"Pinterest is becoming a popular way for small businesses to promote their brands and get their names out there. But using Pinterest to successfully market your business by drumming up interest in repining your content isn’t as easy as it looks. There is more to it than simply having a good product.

43% of social media users have purchased a product after sharing or favoriting it on Pinterest, Facebook or Twitter.

What makes Pinterest the most interesting of the social networking sites is that it is actually oriented around the merchants. The pins are mostly links to cool products that the person likes. There are links to other interesting things, but most of it is for sale.

Businesses are cropping up to exploit Pinterest and generate sales where it would otherwise be difficult. This is the holy grail of social networking for the marketing people out there.

Case study example: Travel Channel - Pinterest is great for finding destinations to visit, things to do, fun travel tips and tools, and lots more. If you’ve got the travel bug, follow the Travel Channel on Pinterest. You’ll find everything from our favorite travel photos, quotes, destinations and travel activities that are on their “bucket list.” They also love to repin interesting travel photos from other Pinners.

Issues to be addressed:

Does purchasing lead to social media sharing, or does social media sharing lead to purchasing?
What are the win strategies for Pinterest?
How to avoid the common mistakes when selling travel on Pinterest?
Learning from best examples on Pinterest.

JDsS2NX7RnE,Travel Trivia: Movies That Give You WANDERLUST! || Movies About Travel,"Time for some fun Travel Trivia! (It's been awhile since we had a trivia night...) Tonight's topic: movies that give you wanderlust. See how many movies you can guess! 

Here's how it works: I have 10 trivia questions for you. I will give you 3 clues for each question. If you guess the movie first (in my chat screen), you get credit for that question. If you guess after the first clue, you get 3 points. If you guess correctly after the second clue, you get 2 points. If you guess correctly after the third clue, you get 1 point. Fastest typing fingers wins! The person with the most points at the end of the game wins a SHOUT-OUT from me in the description box with a link back to his or her channel, and if you are willing to send me your address, a lucky rabbit's foot!

We met travelling around India, and quickly agreed that rather than “settling down” and doing what most normal people do, we wanted to travel and adventure instead and started our sailing lifestyle adventure stories, since then, we’ve been working hard towards achieving our dreams, and now we’re finally living them as sailing cruising lifestyle!

Kd2o30dgqUk,How to choose a cruise ship cabin,"Your room on a cruise ship is called a cabin (or stateroom) and is akin to a hotel room, but typically much smaller. Choosing a cruise ship cabin can be fun and challenging at the same time, and not just a little bit frustrating on occasion. Cabins fall into different types or ""categories,"" and some cruise lines will present as many as 20 or more categories per ship. Before you get overwhelmed, we have some easy ways to figure out which is the right choice for you!

4s_XHZ_897E,Choosing the winner for the new Kickstarter travel/camera bag  - Trey Ratcliff,"Right before Burning Man, I did a live YouTube to talk about the awesome new bags at https://www.stuckincustoms.com/links/travel-bag  

We held a fun comment-competition for someone and their friend to win the bag. Now it's time to choose the winner! 

I partnered with Peak Design on our previous bags.  You can go see those amazing bags at https://www.stuckincustoms.com/links/peakdesign, which are already available.

Oh, and HOT NEWS. This Kickstarter is going so well that they are about to run out of units for early delivery! So, soon you may have to bid on another reward that means it will take a while longer to get the new bag. So, get in pronto!

Presented by Digital Nomad, International Travel Writer & Bestselling Author G. Gabrielle from SassyZenGirl Lifestyle - http://SassyZenGirl.com

""How to become a Digital Nomad?"" is one of the questions I get asked the most, along with tips for smart travelling, travelling for free and sustaining a location independent lifestyle.

So I created this extensive resource for anyone interested in a Digital Nomad Lifestyle - or anyone just wanting to save BIG TME on travel.

You will find advice on:

- how to score FREE Flights & Accommodation 

- how to find discount coupons in seconds 

- how to find mistakes airfares (like my flight from New York to Paris for $137….) 

- how to GET PAID to travel…. 

- solid strategies to finance long term travel

You will find lots of ideas and job listing sites for Digital Nomad Jobs = Jobs you can do from anywhere and jobs that require travel.

You will also learn how you can start a remote, location independent business that can help sustain long term travel. And don’t worry if you think you have no special skills - there is something for everybody - and it can easily be started while working a regular full-time day job.

SassyZenGirl Lifestyle has helped people from all walks of life to achieve Location Independence and Travel Freedom - and evolve into ""Digital Nomads”. If long term travel and location independence is your dream, no resource will make it easier (and less expensive) to get started - and with a solid foundation.

g5iciR-Z_1o,"Live, Love, and Laugh in Thailand-LIVE","#DoMoreLife #Travel #Thailand
Watch my face and listen to my words in this YouTube live stream as I discuss how I live, love, and laugh in Thailand. Living and working in Thailand is such a privileged. Through my Thailand travel vlogs, I try to explain why traveling Thailand, even with a full time teaching job, creates a freedom in your life that you will rarely experience. Many questions from the comments in this video were related to places like Hua Hin, bangkok, Chiang Mai, Ko samui, and other islands in Thailand, which I have not been to yet. 
The good news is, the more I communicate with the subscribers of this YouTube channel, the more I enjoy life in Thailand, and the potential for exploration of more of this country, other than weekends in Pattaya, Thailand.
Thailand travel has really taught me to love, laugh, and appreciate the little things in my life. I would like to thank you all for the superchats, which enable me to bring you more content each month. I love you guys, and can't wait to show you more of Thailand, and Southeast Asia!

CWGb3tsccQ4,11 Reasons to Visit Bangkok Thailand,"I just came back from Bangkok, and wanted to share 11 reasons that you should consider going to Bangkok in Thailand!  From the food, amazing hotels, friendliness of the Thai people, the culture, the history, there are tons of reasons to visit Bangkok!  EXPAND DESCRIPTION FOR MORE!

1. Food

-  Thai food is popular around the world, but come here to eat REAL Thai food
Curries, Noodles, but try something new like Durian, and oh so much more!
Huge river prawns
Thai Iced Thai
Coconut everything, drinks, ice cream
Mango Everything, Mango Sticky Rice, Mango Drinks, etc.
Yes, the Pad Thai is better here!
Tip Sammai pad thai
Oddly enough, McDonalds is everywhere in Bangkok

- Stayed away from food on the street, and stuck to food courts, stalls, places generally with running water

2. Cheap

- Thailand is famously cheap, and I didn’t really appreciate how cheap it was until we were actually there.
- Exchange rate is about 1 USD to 32 Thai Baht
You can get a plate of noodles, or a curry for 30 Baht no problem!
You can try a lot of different things, and since it’s only a buck, who cares if it isn’t good or you don’t eat it all?
Want a whole coconut to drink from?  40 Baht.  Might be $5-10 in the US for that coconut
We eat tons of Mango Sticky Rice since it was like $1 USD a portion
Most of our cheap meals for 2 people were on average about $5
- Taxi rides… a 40 minute taxi ride cost 100 Baht, that’s 4 bucks!
Bottled water…. at the airport, 7 Baht, 30 cents!
Sky Train, starts at like 16 Baht… 50 cents a ride
Ferry ride across the river, 4 Baht.

3. Luxury experiences

- High end dining, personal drivers, the kind of things you could never afford back home are reasonably priced in Bangkok

4. Temples

Old and New
The Royal Palace — this is the one place that isn’t cheap!  It cost 500 Baht to enter. What???
But the Royal Palace was totally over the top! Gold, gold, and more gold!

lo53lV_-8_8,Maui or Kauai – Which Hawaiian Island is Best?,"I’m fresh back from Kauai and I wanted to answer a question I get quite a bit, “Which Hawaiian Island is Better, Maui or Kauai?” Maui is an destination with wide appeal and easily accessible attractions.  Maui is a cross between Oahu and Kauai.  Kauai is rural, rugged, and less touristy.  EXPAND DESCRIPTION FOR MORE.

Maui:  Wide Appeal and Accessible.  A cross between Oahu and Kauai.  The quintessential “honey-mooners” Island.  fancy restaurants, beachfront accommodations and lovely scenery.
Cons: too touristy, too traffic congested, but more flights because it is more touristy, which means they might be cheaper.

Kauai: Rural and Rugged.  Lush, beautiful and fairly vacant.  Nature is more exotic.  Wander in to the jungle and find a place to swim. adventure and quiet.  Local and Laid Back. Much of its treasures require an arduous hunt, hike, kayak, camp. Overall less touristy.  
Cons: The beaches aren’t good for swimming, or are hard to get to.  Nothing to do at night.  Less direct flights.

But really you can’t go wrong with either Island.. It’s Hawaii after all!

I’ll be comparing in 10 different areas.

1 - Beaches:
Maui: The beaches in Wailea have been voted some of the best in the US.  Sandy bottom, easy access, and great snorkeling (Black Rock on Kaanapali ) due to calmer water.  Big Beach is beautiful.  Beach in Kaanapali is rocky.  Swimming overall better in Maui.
Kauai: Very few sandy beaches… long hikes to the really good ones.  Choppy, rocky, windy, waves.

2- Food: 
Maui: Better -- more varied.  Kihei and Lahaina.  Mamas fish house is super cool.  true corporate Americana like Bubba Gump Shrimp Co and Ruth’s Chris Prime Steakhouse just in case you get home sick
Kauai: Really local -- and expensive.  Lots of “take-out.”  Great if you like to picnic.  You better eat lunch by 2pm and dinner by 8pm though.  Few options past 9pm.  You really need to “plan” your meals cause there aren’t alot of options.

3- Nightlife:
Maui: Mostly in Lahaina, and at the resorts in Wailea and Kaanapali.
Kauai: None.  Well -- maybe the movie theater (4 screens) at Kukui Grove or the Luau at the Hyatt.

4- Hotels:  
In Maui there are two main areas, Wailea, and Kaanapali.  Kaanapali has big high-rise hotels.  Wailea has more high end resorts.  Andaz all the way!
In Kauai no building can be taller than a palm tree -- best is the St. Regis and the Hyatt.  Condos are popular options.

5- Driving:
Maui: Can drive around the whole island.  Road to Hana is famous.  Road hugs the coast.  one of the most beautiful, scenic drives in the world with waterfalls and beaches at every hairpin turn.  Get out and explore on the Road to Hana.  Black, Red sand beaches.  Maui is overall more accessible.
Kauai: Can’t drive around… road mostly inland

6- Shopping:
Maui: All big box stores (Target, Walmart, Costco, Whole Foods) by the airport.  Outlet Mall in Lahaina, shopping street in Lahaina.  High end shopping in Wailea and Kaanapali Beach.
Kauai: Big box stores also by the airport.  Kukui Grove the only main shopping center.

7- Hiking:
 If you like out doors stuff, then you'll love Kauai.
Kauai: world-class trails with unreal views and rugged terrain. no handrails, no paved paths and few stairs. If you like breathtaking – and dangerous – hikes, go to Kauai.

8- Adventure:
Boat tours: More relaxing in Maui.  More exciting in Kauai (bigger waves).
Helicopter tours: Kauai
Kayak: Kauai Rivers
Snorkeling: Maui
Whale Watching: Maui

9- Big Attractions Maui:
Haleakala Mountain Observatory and Crater -- 10,000 feet - large dormant volcano taking up 40% of the island. You can drive, bike, or hike parts of the volcano, and it’s really popular for the sunrise though anytime is really cool.

Blowhole -- big!
Lahaina - 150 year old Banyan tree

9B - Big Attractions Kauai: 
Waimea Canyon - Grand Canyon of the Pacific
Napali Coast - the undeveloped coast -- think Jurassic Park.  boat, kayak, or hike.
Waterfalls
Blowhole -- Lizard sound!

10 Conclusion:
Broad appeal and accessibility: Maui
Adventure and alone time: Kauai

We met travelling around India, and quickly agreed that rather than “settling down” and doing what most normal people do, we wanted to travel and adventure instead and started our sailing lifestyle adventure stories, since then, we’ve been working hard towards achieving our dreams, and now we’re finally living them as sailing cruising lifestyle!

1CN6I_Q4cpA,Australia vs USA: 20 Differences,"20 Differences between Australia and the USA.  I recently spent 2 weeks in Australia, and in many ways it seems similar to the USA, but the things that are different definitely stand out!  EXPAND DESCRIPTION FOR TABLE OF CONTENTS.  I share some of the things that I found to be most different between Australia and the USA. As an American, I had a view of Australia being like what I’ve seen in the Crocodile Dundee movies… and well… not everybody in Australia carries a huge knife!

1 - Australian English
    Parking Lot - Car Park
    Opening Hours - Trading Hours
    Pot/Pint of Beer - Small Glass or Big Glass
    Jumper - Jacket
    lollis - hard candies
    Bloke - guy
    Mate - friend
    No worries - no problem
    Uni - University
    Maccas - Mcdonalds
    Sunnies - sunglasses
    Brekkie - breakfast
    Roo - Kangaroo
2 - Store Hours
    Stores in Australia seem to have really early closing hours
3 - Paying at restaurants
    In Australia it is often at the front of the store, not with the server
4 - Tipping
    No tipping in Australia
5 - Paper money in different sizes
    From small to big based on currency
    And there aren’t any pennies in Australia
    5 cents is the smallest coin
6 - Prices include Tax
    I quite like this one
7 - Credit card fees are Rampant
    Taxis charge extra for using a credit card
8 - Cars drive on the left instead of the right
    But people don’t seem to walk on the left instead of the right
    Sidewalk Chaos!
    No turn on red
9 - Dates are reversed
    Day then month instead of Month then Day
10 - Imperial vs Metric
    Celsius vs Fahrenheit
    Miles vs Kilometers
11 - Way more south Asian Food
    Singaporean & Malaysian food is plentiful in Australia
12 - Knife and Fork etiquette
    Australians keep their knife and the fork held all the time
13 - Coffee
    Australian coffee is espresso based
    Much stronger than American coffee
14 - Summer vs Winter
    Seasons are reversed
    I left a heat wave in California to arrive to 1 Degree C in Australia
15 - Sports
    Australians love their sports!
    Australian Rules Football - Footy - Circle Court
    Cricket!
    Multiple teams to a city
    No ‘college’ sports
16 - Australian Calendar starts on Monday
    Makes sense -- it’s the beginning of the work week
    Why does the US Calendar start on Sunday?
17 - Power outlets
    I’ve never seen Australian power outlets anywhere else
18 - Much more water conscious
    Australians are taught to only take 3 minute showers
    And most toilets have 2 buttons, light flush and big flush
19 - Electric Tea Kettles
    Push a button and the water gets hot!
    No stove required!
20 - Population Size
    For about the same size as the continental US, Australia has way less people
    Australian Population: 23 Million
    USA Population: 323 Million

⛵ About Us: This is us, an Aussie girl and a British guy and for some reason, we’ve become completely obsessed with the idea of sailing around the world and sharing our experiences and information through our sailing lifestyle videos with others. 

We met travelling around India, and quickly agreed that rather than “settling down” and doing what most normal people do, we wanted to travel and adventure instead and started our sailing lifestyle adventure stories, since then, we’ve been working hard towards achieving our dreams, and now we’re finally living them as sailing cruising lifestyle!

_UimbSBGZ1k,How To Have Fun in Las Vegas WITHOUT Gambling,"15 ways to have fun in Las Vegas WITHOUT gambling or drinking.  Many people think of Las Vegas as a destination ONLY for gambling, drinking, and smoking.  But there are a ton more fun things to do in Las Vegas.  EXPAND DESCRIPTION FOR MORE INFO

1 - Walk the strip

4.5 Miles from Mandalay Bay to the Las Vegas Strip

2 - People watching

Sit at a stripside restaurant and watch the people go by
Best after sunset
Late at night, watch the girls walking in bare feet holding their high heels

3 - Hotel Hopping

You can spend days doing this
Mega resorts, many of the biggest hotels in the world
“Less is more"" -- not here!
On the strip and off the strip

Favorite: Venetian
Gondolas, Canals, Shops, Grand Canal Bridge, Wax Museum

Fav: NYNY: Great theming

Bellagio
botanical gardens and the colorful lobby in the Bellagio including the chandelier “Fiori di Como” by glass sculptor Dale Chihuly.

Fountains at Bellagio. Perfectly choreographed, the 1,000 fountains shoot majestically into the air dancing gracefully to lights and songs by Andrea Bocelli, Luciano Pavarotti and other greats

Wynn:
At dusk visit the free “Lake of Dreams” at the Wynn Hotel which includes a light show

Luxor - Pyramid
Excalibur - Castle
Ceasars Palace - Old Rome (forum shops)
Paris - Eifel Tower
TI - Pirate Ship
Mirage - For the volcano that shoots 100 feet in the air

4 - Ride all the free monorails and trams
Mandalay to Excalibur
Park MGM to Bellagio
Mirage to Treasure Island

5 - Ride the thrill rides

NYNY Roller Coaster $15
Circus Circus Adventure Dome
Stratosphere rides
1,149-foot Stratosphere tower, visitors can jump the world’s tallest free fall or play it a bit safer by riding one of several attractions.
Ride the big Ferris Wheel at the Linq

6 - Play video games 
Arcade at the NYNY, Circus Circus
But the Pinball Hall of Fame is my favorite

7 - Freemont Street Experience - Aka downtown 

Classic Las Vegas
Night time show on the big LED roof - 12.5 million lights
Zip line
Concerts
Neon signs (even a museum) with 150 vintage signs.  Make a reservation 

8 - See a show

If you really want to see a particular show then buy a ticket in advance to make sure you get a seat.  Discount ticket options are on the strip for same or next day tickets. 

I really like Blue Man Group

Cirque de Soleil has a gazillion shows on the strip

Be careful if you have kids.. lots of shows are topless

9 - Shop
On the strip: Fashion Show Mall, Crystals
But almost every hotel has it's own shopping area
Via Bellagio,the Wynn Esplanade, Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian, Forum Shops at Caesar’s Palace, Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood, Mandalay Place
Also Outlet Shopping near the airport and near downtown

M & M’s World and World of Coca Cola

10 - Animals


11 - Lounge at the Pool or a Spa

Mandalay Bay pool is quite impressive 

Some pools are strictly for hotel guests, while others allow non-hotel guests for a cover charge ranging on average from $20 to $30 or a cabana rental. Keep in mind some pools open to non-hotel guests only do so Friday through Sunday.

more relaxed poolside experience is offered at the Garden of the Gods Pool Oasis at Caesars Palace. There you’ll find seven pools, 44 cabanas, and swim-up blackjack in a Roman oasis.

Most Vegas hotels have mega spas - saunas, steam rooms, massages and indoor pools

12 - Take a day trip

Hoover Dam
Lake Las Vegas
Grand Canyon

13 - Take the Iconic Selfie
At the Welcome to Las Vegas Sign by the Mandalay Bay

14 - Eat
Cheap eats, Expensive Eats, and buffets 

Favorite cheap eat: Earl of Sandwich
Favorite Buffet: Aria

Buffet tip: Pick a time overlapping meal times, Brekkie and Lunch, or Lunch and Dinner

Eataly is coming soon to Park MGM

Tim Ho Wan is coming to the Palms

15 - In-N-Out Company Store -- I always visit

Don't miss the live stream tonight at 7:30pm Bangkok Time. Check out and share the podcast from this morning titled, ""Set Yourself Up for a Successful Vacation or Retirement in Thailand, or any other Country in the World."" It has some useful tips for anyone coming to Thailand, and it is less than 10 minutes long! Also, there is a possibility that I will be moving to Vietnam in late March or early April. I will release much more information on that topic as it becomes available.

Thank you all for your support. Just another reason I love making travel vlogs and being an expat in Thailand.",Travel

cHcgrFDu8Qg,Japanese Hotels vs American Hotels - 14 Differences,"Staying at hotels in Japan is a very unique experience.  From the amazing utilization of space, to the wonderful service, I compare and contrast the differences between Japanese “Western Style” hotels in Japan and the same types of “Business” hotels in the USA. Japan has lots of type of hotels, Capsule Hotels, Manga Cafes, Hostels, Love Hotels, Overnight Buses, Traditional Japanese Inns (Ryokans).  I’ll be comparing Japanese “Western Style” or “Business” hotels in big cities like Osaka, Tokyo, etc.

1 - Location: In Japan better to be closer to a train station… right on top of the train station is the best.  Or connected to the train station.  Hotels advertise how many mins walk they are from the station.

2 - Room types:  Japanese hotels have a gazillion room types and packages.  Not obvious from the english website.  Different meal plans, pork, chicken, beef.  “Hollywood Twin Room” one where the twin beds are seperate.  I almost never book the cheapest room type.

3 - People in the room:  Very strict in Japan.  Adults and children.  Also how many men and how many women? In the US it usually doesn’t matter.

4 - Arriving at the hotel: They really want to take your luggage.  And they don’t expect a tip.  Service in a Japanese hotel takes on a whole new level.

5 - Parking:  Don’t expect parking.  Maybe an “elevator” or “ferris wheel” type garage.  Often no parking, or parking 5 blocks away.  

6 - Check-in: Very thorough in Japan.  Always fill-out a card.  Show passport.

7 - The room itself:  Japanese rooms are small.  And by small I mean really small!

Mattress -- often on the firm side.

Pillows -- filled with beans.  And usually only one.

Bathrooms: Smart toilets.  Bathroom amenities.  Handheld shower.  Stool.  Toilet slippers. Deep bath tubs.  Often “modular”

Pajamas -- sometimes western style, other times Yukata.

Always a Tea Kettle, and tea.

Air purifier, humidifier.

Often a pants press, and fabric freshener spray.

8 - Breakfast:  Japanese & Western Style Breakfasts.  Japanese breakfast is usually a set meal.  Western breakfast is usually a buffet.  Japanese chains usually have a more elaborate breakfast per price than western hotels.  Ice Cream!  And always a breakfast coupon.  You can always find a 7-11 near by.

9 - Room Service:  Usually not an option -- but in-room massage service is.

10 - Hotel Bar:  Only if they cater to westerners -- otherwise a beer vending machine.

11 - Gym: What’s that?  Only if they cater to westerners -- make you sign a waiver.

12 - Pool: Wear a swim cap and goggles!

13 - Check-out: Is still a process.  Often a check-out gift.  No mobile or TV check-out.



14- Onsen Hotels.
Typically in the countryside
City dwellers retreat for the weekend to get away
Kyoto has some Ryokans
Often small and family run.
Arriving -- check in is shorter
your personal room attendant shows you to your room
Makes tea with snack, explains the hotel.
minimalistic tatami mat room
No shoes (off at the room, or front of hotel)
yukata – a Japanese-style robe – and slippers
Japanese futon bedding
shoji screens made from strong rice paper that “slide” instead of swing
table called a zataku instead of a Western table. (short legs, sigh ton the floor) 
Legless chairs and floor pillows surround the table. 
In colder months, it may have an embedded heater to keep your legs warm.
Maybe no shower/bath in the room.

""Life is short, break the rules, forgive quickly, kiss slowly, love truly, laugh uncontrollably, and never regret anything that made you smile. Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover."" ― Mark Twain

BobGLm4k08Q,Disneyland vs Universal Studios Hollywood: 10 Differences,"Which theme park is better, Disneyland versus Universal Studios Hollywood.  Wondering which park to visit on your trip to Los Angeles?  I compare Disneyland and Universal Studios in 10 different areas.  EXPAND DESCRIPTION FOR MORE.

1 - Park Themes:
Disney: characters and setting from the Disney movie franchise with a large emphasis on their animated films, Mickey, and Minnie Mouse.  But Star Wars is coming soon!  Many rides for fans 2-10 years of age.  And hard-core disney fans, and loyalists.


Universal: Inspired by popular films plus, the movie industry in Hollywood and film production itself with tours of the working studio included with the park’s general admission.  Gear to a more mature audience than Disneyland

2 - Park Location:
Disney: Anaheim, California -- Orange County.  34 miles south-east of LAX Airport.  About the only thing worth visiting in Anaheim is Disneyland…. And a bunch of things that cater to people who go to Disneyland.  LOTS OF HOTELS!

Universal: Hollywood, 10 miles north-east of downtown LA, on a hill overlooking LA.  26 miles from LAX Airport.  36 miles from Disneyland.

3 - Park Layout:
Disney: 2 Theme Parks, Downtown Disney, Disney Hotels on Property, Monorail, Parking Far Away (parking tram or bus), multiple days to see it all

Universal: Split-level themepark that is pretty small, Universal City Walk, Hilton + Sheraton, Parking Close By, LA Subway, studio tour tram, can do it all in one day

4 - Crowds:
Disney: Usually it’s packed, all the time.  Parking can take forever.  Security and park entry lines can be long.  Ride lines can be long, 60-90 minutes.

Universal: Way less people most of the summer (summer can be rough).  An hour before park closing time of 9pm lines for many rides were 10 minutes.  Easy to get in to parking, short lines for park entry.

5 - Skip the line:
Disney: Fast pass, Max Pass
Universal: Pay for Express Pass, skip each line once (good if you have limited time)

6 - Kids:
 Disney: 
  = Younger Kids, more strollers
  = Height limit on many rides is 44 inches
  = Child Switch via Fast Pass Return
 Universal: 
  = Older Kids, not too many strollers
  = Height limit 40 inches
  = Child Switch Rooms

7 - Characters:
 Disney: 
  = Long Lines for character meet and greet, but long time with the characters
  = Characters act “classy”
 Universal:
  = Shorter lines for character pictures, but maybe not known to kids
  = Characters will interact and joke with you walking by
  = Minions, Transformers, Simpsons, Beetlejuice, Kung Fu Panda, Dora the Explorer, SpongeBob 

8 - Costumes:
 Disney: Ears, Hats, Matching Shirts
 Universal: Harry Potter Robes

9 - Attractions/Rides:
Disney: 
  = Amazing theming on the rides, want to ride again and again
  = Best Land: Cars Land
Universal: 
  = Lots of motion projection rides (barf!).  Once and never again. 
  = Many rides feel like they aren’t “done”
  = Best Land: Wizarding World of Harry Potter, 
  = Best Ride: Studio Tour

10 - Shows:
Disney: Parades, Frozen, Fireworks, Fantasmic, World of Color
Universal: Waterworld, Animal Actors, Special Effects Show

Conclusion:

Price:  About the same for 1 day tix.  Annual Passes at Universal are cheaper.
Age: Disneyland better for ages 2-10
Location: Universal better for LA attractions
Time: Universal done in a day (15 attractions).  Disney 2-3 days (100 attractions)
Theme: Disneyland is for Disney lovers and it’s very immersive and well done.  Universal is for “movie” and Harry Potter fans.

I like Disneyland best. Amazing Experience and atmosphere...You can wander around Disneyland and have a good time without going on a single ride. There's music and entertainment, exhibits, etc.  Go early in the day, and use fast pass.

NEXT LIVE STREAM: Monday March 19, 2018 @ 8pm LA time!  Topic: TBD!  Follow me on Facebook for more updates!

lA-b7ktlsiw,How Cruise Lines Promote New Ships And Get Rid Of Old Ships,"How Cruise Lines Promote New Ships And Get Rid Of Old Ships  Cruise ships get old just like we do and they either get refurbished or move on to secondary cruise lines.  The big name cruise lines do not like to operate cruise ships that look old or continually break down.  Plus they like to be known as cruise trend setters to their travellers.  It is not uncommon for a cruse ship to have up to 4 or 5 owners in a 40 year time span.

Thinking about going on a cruise?  Here are a few items to get for the perfect cruise:

Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor.

✩OUR STORY: Backroads of Montana. Watch Video here: http://tinyurl.com/jr2efug

I'm originally from Fier, Albania. I grew up in Roskovec until I finished the 8th grade and then immigrated to Italy on my own to look for work opportunities. I ended up being taken in by a school for boys without families, ""Fondazione il Faro"", in Rome. There, they tried to integrate us into the community by teaching us the Italian language as well as giving us technical skills like making pizza, cutting hair, carpentry and computer programming. After a year at the school, I found my first job as a waiter in a vegetarian restaurant. The work was challenging and I loved it. I waited tables for the next six years, working at renowned Roman restaurants learning a great deal about Italian food and wine in the process.

In 2004, I met my wife, Kaleigh, a Montana native, who was a student traveling and studying in Rome...

xTMarg1dGRk,Transparency| Successful Single Mom Shares Her Struggles and Motivates Others,"I'm a single black mom (30yrs)  that has been traveling the world full time with my 9-year-old son for over a year and a half. We have traveled using several methods of transportation and have stayed in several countries using various accommodations. We are not on vacation! This is real life for us! We work and homeschool as we travel, and this is a dream come true for us! I completely carved out this lifestyle for us based on our current needs and desires now and later. We are not millionaires and we have not stayed anywhere for free using Couchsurfing, Woofing or Workaway. We think that these are great resources, and simply want people to know that they don't have to rely on these platforms to completely make their traveling dreams come true as well. Also, I forgot to mention that we have not used our credit cards, but once to rent a car. If you have ever wanted to ask us something personal about our finances and lifestyle organization...Tune in to this live stream and ask anything or comment later and we will try our best to answer anything NOT answered in the video! 

***Thank you to all who tuned in! Our live video was very interactive and I loved this. Due to slight connection interruptions on the replay,, me getting attacked by mosquitoes and length of this live stream... lol I will be rerecording this subject another time. This video will eventually be removed soon so please pull up a chair and watch later tonight if you can. I am using this experience as documentation for another learning experience. My goal is to learn how to prepare my streams better as I inform, entertain and manage a larger audience. Thank you for your patience! See you soon again.

About Us:

My name is Bionca and I have a 9 yr old son named Carter. I’m a cultured high energy globetrotting life coach, public speaker and soon to be an author. Carter is a spiritual goofy home schooled kid, gamer, and humanitarian. Together we want to inspire others to be bold enough to chase their dreams despite any challenges along the way.

 Our journey began a year ago we decided to get rid of our fancy things, home school and travel the world until further notice. Then in October 2017, we decided to buy a van that would enable us to work, home school, explore the world and give back in the U.S! This 1989 Ford Econoline is a symbol of freedom and service to various communities. 

Our values (L.E.G)
Learn
Engage
Give back

Some examples of what Carter and I love to do throughout our travels:

-Life coaching and delivering empowering speeches which include speaking on the issues of bullying in schools.
-Learn and explore various regions of the world while engaging with locals
-Cook delicious foods
-Host play date meetups for traveling families with kids
-Feed the homeless
-Rescue animals
-Clean up beaches

Right now we wish to relaunch an anti-bullying nonprofit foundation called the Bully Barricade Foundation. It is going to take a lot of work and we need your help! 

We hope to meet many of you during our travels! 
With love, 

-Bionca and Carter

lY6wH6sXjmA,Packing Carry On Only For A 12 Night Cruise - Men&#39;s Edition,"Hi Cruisers, It's time for another of our Packing Carry On Only videos. This time we really have a packing challenge ahead of us. We are doing a 12 night Asia cruise on the Diamond Princess, with a very long flight included.  Don't forget our wonderful sponsor: https://cruiseline.com?utm_source=youtube&utm_campaign=cttv
 
If you've watched any of our previous videos, you know that when driving to port we tend to be pretty relaxed with our cruise packing. Some would say I'm am an over-packer. But when we fly it's a whole different story. We don't want to deal with baggage fees, waiting at luggage carousels, and hauling heavy suitcases around an airport.  On this trip we'll be continuing our habit of packing carry on only for cruises. We are starting to perfect this carry on only strategy, and we've got lots of packing tips for carry on only to share with you.  We'll be splitting the packing into three parts, and this is part one (packing carry on only for men). This time we'll focus solely on carry on only for men (all my husband's stuff), and next we'll do a packing carry on only for a cruise with kids, or maybe packing for women.   If you are working on packing light, carry on only is definitely something you should consider. Packing for a cruise can be stressful, but for us adding airport considerations to the mix makes it that much more daunting.  As always, if you have packing tips, carry on only tips, or any tips you think might be helpful to our wonderful cruising community, please share them in the comments below. 

Want more? The NEW CTTV Academy is here! 20 how-to vids, packing lists and a private Facebook page for students and coaches. Join the crash course here: http://cruisetipstv.thinkific.com/courses/masterclass

https://cruiseline.com?utm_source=youtube&utm_campaign=cttv 

Hey cruisers! Thanks for joining us for our first ever LIVE cruise pack with me video. We are driving to port, not flying, so this is not considered a packing light cruise. I’m nearly finished with my packing for our Carnival Cruise Line Splendor Cruise, and we're excited to show you what clothes and shoes we're packing for the whole family. Last week, on our Cruise Gear channel, we went live to show you our toiletries and gear, up close. We had a GREAT turnout, so if you missed our live gear packing video, you can find it here: https://youtu.be/7qG0khnamaI 

Today, I’ll show you in depth what my carry on, backpack, and regular suitcase is stuffed with.  Can’t wait to see YOU in the chat!

AFFILIATE LINK DISCLOSURE: Friends, making a quality Loloho video is kind of like making sausage – only slightly more violent. It's a ridiculous amount of work that typically involves high dollar camera drops, blue-screen-of-death computer crashes, and at least one angry shotgun wielding old man shouting, “Hey! Get the hell outta here!” Once the final video is posted, rewards here on YouTube are few and far between (unless you are a masochist who enjoys being verbally abused by anonymous trolls). One saving grace is our affiliate links. JUST CLICKING THESE LINKS HELPS TO SUPPORT OUR LITTLE SHOW. Think of this clicking as like tipping - except that it doesn't cost you anything extra! If you eventually make a purchase via one of our affiliate links, we will receive a few pennies (and Sean typically invests these pennies in duct tape and video gear).
