Factory activity in New York state hit a nearly two-year low this month, offering further evidence of a sharp slowdown in economic growth. Federal officials are scheduled to meet next Tuesday and Wednesday to assess the economy. The economy is reportedly losing steam as the stimulus from last year’s $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades. One economist said, ""The economy is spinning its wheels and not gaining any traction yet.""

eF5LVBW1vl8,Manufacturing plywood boards: then and now,"Plywood is a simple material made by glueing together thin sheets of wood, known as veneers or plies. These basic elements have remained broadly the same throughout its history. The most significant breakthrough in its production came in the early 1800s with the development of steam-powered machines that could cut veneers cheaply. The most influential of these was the rotary veneer cutter.

The cutter rotates a log against a wide, horizontal blade, causing it to ‘peel’ into a continuous sheet of wood. This enables the creation of longer, wider sheets of veneer than previously possible and with little waste. Using these machines meant that plywood could be manufactured quickly and inexpensively on a large scale.

This film shows the stages in manufacturing plywood boards in the mid-20th century and today. The process remains essentially unchanged, although today many of the machines are much faster and computer controlled.

Consisting of turning and adaptive milling on a Hermle C50U MT mill/turn machining centre. By combining innovative 5-axis machining strategies with conical barrel cutters (supplied by Technicut), the milling cycle time was slashed from 200 hours to 35 (a saving of 83%) or £18,150 per blade. At the same time, tooling costs were reduced by 72%.

Once complete, the full blisk was polished using a Fanuc M-710iC industrial robot cell.

kwozInrGog0,Traditional manufacturing of childrens wooden toys in Hrvatsko Zagorje,"UNESCO: Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity - 2009
URL: http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/RL/00233
Description: Villagers along the pilgrimage route to the Marian shrine of Our Lady of the Snow in Marija Bistrica in Hrvatsko Zagorje in northern Croatia developed a technique for traditional manufacturing of childrens wooden toys that has now been handed down for generations. The men in a family take soft willow, lime, beech and maple wood from the region and dry, hew, cut and carve it using traditional tools; the women then apply ecologically-friendly paint in improvisational floral or geometric patterns, painting from imagination. The whistles, horses, cars, tiny furniture, spinning dancers, jumping horses and flapping birds produced today are almost identical to those made more than a century ago  though no two toys are precisely the same, thanks to the handcrafted production process. Popular among both locals and tourists, these toys are sold in parish fairs, markets and specialty shops around the world. They have also evolved with the times and, in addition to the traditional shapes such as horses and carts, new ones representing cars, trucks, airplanes and trains have appeared, reflecting the world surrounding modern-day children. Tiny toy instruments, carefully tuned as they are created, still serve as important components in the musical education of rural children.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why are 'Made in China' products cheaper than 'Made in India

So the question now is why does their product use so much? have you ever wondered ? Because he is cheap, so why is his product affordable? Why can not India make such a cheap product?

Labor is found in the lowest penny in China
China's Anual Average Productivity Growth
Most Raw Materials at Domestic Level
Competitive pricing
Expense on innovation or r & d
Duplicate product
Dumping Strategy
Product export in other countries
Break the market


So what should India do to come forward in this way?

1) Commericial rule, making bussiness easy
2) Improvement in manufacturing and agriculture sector
3) Multispecialist to Labor
4) Export has to be improved,
5) Stop buying their product

MANUFACURE OF PORTLAND CEMENT:Raw Materials: The raw materials required for cement manufacture are. Lime stone which provides calcium. Clay which provides aluminium and silica.Cement is manufactured by two methods they are. Wet process. Dry process. Now let us discuss wet process and dry process detailed.WET PROCESS:In the wet process, first the clay is purified by washing in a wash mill.The lime stone is crushed into small particles and mixed with purified clay in proper proportions to get raw slurry.DRY PROCESS: In the dry process the raw materials are mixed in proper proportions.The mixture is dried, pulverized (Crushed into fine particles) and made uniform. The resulting powder is called ""raw material"".The raw slurry or raw meal, obtained by one of wet or dry process called charge. Charge is introduced into a rotary Kiln.The rotary kiln consists of a steel cylinder about 150meters long and 4meter diameter and rotates 30 to 60 turns per hour.At one end of the cylinder a screw conveyer is arranged which slowly allows the charge into the cylinder.The other end of the cylinder, a burneris arranged coal or burning oil is burnt at this end.The charge entering the cylinder slowly moves towards the hot end.At the burning end of the kiln, the temperature is around 1700 to 1900degrees centigrade, at this end some chemical reactions takes place between calcium oxide and aluminium silicates.Mixture of calcium silicates and calcium aluminates is formed.The resultant product consists of gray hard balls called clinker cement.Clinker cement is cooled, ground to fine powder and mixed with 2 to 3 percent of gypsum.",Manufacturing

subeIZgLquI,How To Make A T-Shirt From Design To Manufacturing Process,"In this video I show you how to make a t-shirt from the design to manufacturing process. It starts with designing a shirt, pattern making, sewing, cutting and then goes into large production manufacturing. More from Bella Canvas: http://bit.ly/2t9Guo6 

When starting a clothing line it's important to know the process, and this video is a great way to learn what it takes to create a t-shirt from scratch. 

Sign up to the newsletter and receive free downloads to help grow your business + enter to win upcoming giveaways:  http://bit.ly/Apparel-Download 

The following steps can be applied to make any product, so feel free to jot down notes and reference this section for future use. 

Step 1: T-Shirt Design 
The first step to making a t-shirt involves the design sketch. Create a sketch that depicts the angles and details you'd like the final shirt to have. It doesn't have to be super fancy, as long as you can show what you need. Designing a shirt with the end goal in mind helps the pattern maker know what you are going for. Thanks you Torey Lewitz for joining us.

Step 2: Pattern Making
Once the designs are completed, you will consult with a pattern maker to bring your clothing line to life. The pattern maker will take your designs and create “patterns” which are the pieces that will be cut and sewn together. 

Step 3: Sample Cutting
Once the patterns are completed, they are printing on a plotter that creates the outline for the sample cutter. The person in charge of cutting the sample will follow the guides to ensure the pieces are cut to the right specifications. Castle Notches allow the person in charge of sewing to close the product up right. 

Step 4: Sewing The T-Shirt
After the fabric is cut out, it is ready to be sewn. The cut pieces are now the shape of the patterns and multiple sewing machines are used to finish the design. The final outcome is hopefully what you envisioned. But more than likely it won’t be the final fit, so you will repeat the process until you are happy with the size, fit and shape of your apparel line. 

Step 5: Mass Production Cutting
As soon as the shirt or apparel design you created is approved, the patterns are finalized and sent into the production process. John Chacon Head Of Production walks us through his process. 

Step 6: Mass Production Sewing 
Once the pieces are all cut out, they are sent to the sewing factory. The factory is given the cut fabric and the head of production is in charge of making sure everyone knows what their role is. 

Step 7: Order Fulfillment/ Clothing Line Distribution
The last step in this video is the order fulfillment and distribution of the finished clothing. As a clothing business you also have to think about how you will provide quicker shipping, handle returns and manage employees. Randy Pinter Head of Warehouse Distribution drops the knowledge on what it takes to run this facility.

==========================

Today we will discuss several of the top PLC manufacturers from around the world. 

There are quite a few, and hopefully, this video will clear up some of the differences between the major brands. 

As technicians, engineers, and programmers, we have several choices when it comes to choosing a brand of PLC. Depending on where you work, you may have to familiarize yourself with many different PLC brands.

Some places use more than one manufacturer in a single facility. So let’s break some of the major brands down so we can see the difference.

7n8bPPkWiOk,Advanced Pharmaceutical Manufacturing,"There are a number of challenges that the industry faces in order to transition towards more competitive, systematic and efficient manufacturing. Regulatory authorities have recognized the deficiencies of pharmaceutical product manufacturing and aim to enhance process understanding through Quality by Design (QbD) and Process Analytical Technology (PAT) tools. As a result of this current effort to change the mindset in order to mimic the rest of the chemical industry, an additional transition is becoming more and more appealing: transition from batch to continuous production mode. However, continuous manufacturing requires detailed process understanding in terms of the evolution of all critical material properties as a function of its operating parameters and environmental conditions. Once process knowledge is translated into models, computer aided dynamic simulation tools will allow the design, analysis and optimization of continuous integrated processes. 

In this talk I will discuss the work that has been done in my lab towards the development of an integrated platform that will enable the efficient flowsheet simulation and analysis, the assessment of design alternatives, the feasibility analysis of the production line, and the control and optimization of process design and operations. 

The developed flowsheet model includes modules for all the necessary unit operations, namely powder feeding, mixing, roller compaction, tablet press and milling integrated to represent a tablet manufacturing line. Models used to represent each unit operation vary from empirical, first-principle or hybrid. Population balance models are developed in order to track the composition and particle size changes throughout complex powder processes dynamically. The developed flowsheet simulation is used to predict the propagation of upstream disturbances to final product quality, the assessment of recycle stream benefits, the identification of process integration bottlenecks and evaluation of different control strategies in order to retain the process within its design space. In addition, global dynamic sensitivity analysis is performed to identify critical process parameters not only within each unit operation, but also between different processes. Finally, simulation based optimization techniques enable the identification of the optimal operating conditions, as well as the optimal design sequence which leads to pharmaceutical tablets with desired characteristics. This work aims to merge knowledge, experience, experimental results and modeling tools for developing a dynamic simulation platform that will enable the safe implementation of the transition towards continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing.

Transcript:

P&G is a fast-moving consumer goods company. We have several different BUs. So we handle the whole spectrum of a person's life stages.

Digital tools are simply critical for us to be able of the
delivering this manufacturing of the future. 

Two and a half years ago we watched the technician re-enter data from one system to the next system for the next system.  It was so disempowering. They were very frustrated that the systems weren't integrated.  We needed a solution that could really scale with us.

The way we operate the business the way people learn is different. And, we have to be ready for that.

Our vision is that each operation team has a tool in their hand
to improve their business results.

Out on the lines on to tablets so they can interact with the data real time at the point that they need to not over back over the desk. Because the work doesn't happen at the desk. Work happens at the piece of equipment.

From our team rooms we went away from you know hard written
paper or single desk typing to touchscreen technology so they can get there and drag new data around. It blew me away.

One of the primary benefit is the flexibility you get in a platform solution. In terms of time savings, energy savings, we're going to at least see 45-minute pressure per line per business unit.

It has the flexibility to look at the same data in different ways that make sense for that particular operational team at that particular time.

The KPIs from that digital platform really help us visualize the operational level. Including process reliability which is really efficiency of the operations, safety and quality.

Too often we provide a solution that is limited.

I'm very confident in GE's ability to expand this outside the factory walls to look at the entire supply chain. 
 
The people that we have worked with at GE when they say they're going to do something they really deliver excellence and they deliver it on time.",Manufacturing

The upper is then ""lasted"", a sole is directly injection moulded onto the upper and finally shoe roomed, inspected and boxed.

TjqRJZswl-U,Exclusive tour of LG&#39;s OLED R&amp;D and manufacturing facilites in South Korea,"Check out our CES 2019 coverage! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZEIwIHCxaFWx-I3KSJo8XKh2JkzWhvZF

LG brought Digital Trends along on an exclusive tour of several of its labs and factories halfway around the globe in Seoul, South Korea -- and we’re bringing you inside with us.

Make no mistake: Much of what we saw was confidential information, of the “I could tell you but I’d have to kill you” sort. But we can share enough to give you a rare peek behind the curtain.

The Paju complex is made up of eight enormous buildings each seemingly larger than an airport terminal that sit on 420 acres. A ninth, called P9, is currently under construction. When completed, it will be the world’s largest OLED manufacturing plant. More than 17,000 people work at Paju, many living in enormous residential complexes on site. 

We flew on the LG helicopter an hour south to the Gumi facility, where LG assembles OLED and LED televisions. It was especially big: Picture several warehouses fused together. It doesn’t require the clean-room garb we donned for phone assembly. Because technology changes so rapidly, assembly lines are designed to be modular. 

The Seocho Research & Development facility. It was born in 2009, and over 3000 people work there, giving birth to high-tech ideas from a glimmering pool of silicon and ambition. And as such, it’s one of the super secretive facilities that LG guards closely: Admission to Seocho meant forfeiting cell phones and laptops, signing non-disclosure forms, and so on. Indeed, we were only allowed to record a short video outside of the building.

Of course, we didn’t include every tool company in this video. Honestly, we didn't have the time! We did, however, do our best to include as many tool brand parent companies as possible. Starting with several of the largest manufacturers who likely own more brands than you think.

GEgaV0aFBsg,Solar Cell Manufacturing with Heterojunction Technology,"The heterojunction technology combines the advantages of crystalline silicon solar cells and thin film technologies enabling solar cell to reach higher degrees of efficiency at a lower cost of production.

This movie shows you the process of manufacturing solar cells with heterojunction technology:

Texturing
For high efficiency HJT cells, damages from cutting have to be completely removed and a special texture created by wet chemical processes. The wafers are also put through a special cleaning process.

PECVD Coating
The surface of the cell is passivated  in order to prevent energy loss within the cell. The intrinsic and amorphous silicon layers are separated without cross-contamination, thus achieving passivation with a high longevity.

PVD Coating
A sputter process is used to apply a TCO layer to the front and back of the wafer which serves as an antireflection layer.

Printing
Screen printing is used to print the contacts on the front and back sides of wafers with silver paste.

Curing
Curing printed HJT cells is a simple thermal process in order to outgas the solvents within the low temperature paste.


Testing & Sorting
Meyer Burger offers leading measurement procedures for the precise testing of high capacitance HJT cells which require a measurement speed of 400–600 ms.",Manufacturing

Wearable technology allows the Quality team to thoroughly inspect tractors while improving standards in safety, checklist documentation, issue trending and throughput.  Although Glass still feels as futuristic of a technology as flying cars, AGCO has embraced the elaborate electronic devices, making use of voice activated commands and eye winks as daily tools.  In addition to the efficiency that voice and eye motion bring to the process, the simple fact that the quality technicians are no longer carrying devices, allowing for hands free inspection and focus on safety has increased throughput, safety records and checkpoint reliability.   Checklists are now smart, following model specifications and presenting instructional diagrams and text that drive the technician’s response and follow-up actions.  Every point on the checklists requires action and offers a level of detail that allows on the job training for newer employees and newly released model specifications. 
As Agricultural equipment companies continue to competitively advance their technologies to help farmers maximize their yield, the complexities to produce the machines increases.  As the world also continues to battle a shortage of skilled manufacturing workers, solutions like wearable technology, offering immediate access to instructions and information will become required.  The company’s that realize this and find solutions will be in positions to not only succeed in, but win, the global markets. #agcocorp",Manufacturing

It is our pleasure to show you around our manufacturing plant for the original 2cv, Mehari and Dyane chassis.

Did you know?

The Mehari 2cv Club Cassis has signed an exclusive operating contract with CITROEN for the remanufacturing of many pieces using the original moulds and tools.

Are you ready?

Come and discover our universe.

The first step is to put in place all the interior frame elements, the inside rails, 

the suspension unit traverses, 

hand brake support, 

safety belt fixings, rear arched reinforcement ...

the support for the front seat rails, and the front arched reinforcement.  

The front traverse is numbered to ensure that the procedure of quality is followed for the production of each chassis.

The elements are positioned and locked together. The first welding points are made.

After this step, all holding points are released, we move to the second assembly phase.

The structure is placed on its lower panel and positioned on the second unit in the assembly line. 

It is  locked in place, and further welding points are made.

The internal reinforcements, and upper panel are put in place. 


A template is used which allows the welder to weld the upper panel and internal side frame to the original Citroën specifications. 

We are not yet in the era of the robotisation.

This step is complete, we move on to the 3rd phase.

The installation of the outer side frame panels.

Again, all is locked. 

The original template is laid on top and the welding is carried out following the template. 

After the upper welding is complete, the lower part can be welded.

The ends are crimped using a mallet.  

The chassis is then installed in the original Citroën frame crimping machine.

This machine folds the edges of the chassis in one passage back and forth.

The platform will now be installed on the original Citroën hole punching machine.

The holes positions are checked.

The machine will now punch over 60 holes at the same time.

The external elements will be added.

The shock absorber and spring tube supports.

The rear towing loops.

The rear exhaust support.

The front towing loops.

The elements are locked in place.

The elements are welded into place.

The elements are released and the welding is finished.

The chassis is then moved to the rotating welding table.

The front and rear axel fixations are locked and welded into place.

The lower reinforcements for the suspension spring tubes are fitted. 

Everything is unlocked.

All that is left to do, is install the fuel tank fixations.

The final step before the anti-corrosion treatment, is to install the driveshaft protection.

We hope you enjoyed the visit.

After production we have two types of anti-corrosion treatment possible.

The hot dip galvanisation at 480 °c.

Or by cataphoresis treatment.

In both cases you benefit from a high quality product protected against corrosion.

I would like to remind you that our chassis are certified and comply with the UTAC standards as required by the manufacturer.

Thank you for your attention.  Safe driving.",Manufacturing

Pushing is a manufacturing method that emphasizes storing a lot of products in order to have them ready to push to customers at a moment's notice. This results in high carrying costs and potentially more unusable inventory as it passes its expiration date.

Pulling is more efficient than pushing. It emphasizes JIT (Just In Time) shipping and only ordering parts and products when customer orders come in. This cuts down on carrying costs and leads to a more streamlined operation. It is slower than the push method, so there is a trade-off.

Laser Deposition Technology (LDT) is a process in which metal powder is injected into the focused beam of a high-power laser under tightly controlled atmospheric conditions. The focused laser beam melts the surface of the target material and generates a small molten pool of base material. Powder delivered into this same spot is absorbed into the melt pool, thus generating a deposit that may range from 0.125 to 1 mm thick and 1 to 4 mm wide. The resulting deposits may then be used to build or repair metal parts for a variety of different applications.

There are three main areas where LDT can be used in manufacturing processes; it can be used in repair of worn components, especially in any type of mechanical equipment with moving parts. This process is known as Laser Repair Technology (LRT). Also, this technique can be used in the application of cladding materials, which known as Laser Cladding Technology (LCT). LCT is a process that repairs surfaces on parts by first machining down the worn surface and building it back up by depositing cladding material in thin layers to restore the worn surface. Finally, this technique can be used in performing near-net-shape freeform builds, which known as Laser Freeform Manufacturing Technology (LFMT). This technique starts with a CAD drawing of a part, from this electronic drawing, a tool path file is built. The laser deposition system then builds the part layer by layer. LFMT can build complex shapes, prototyping and manufacturing some parts in far less time than any other technique.

The following video is a summary of a project that was run for a small manufacturer were we analyzed their production throughput, performed cycle time analysis and review while also tracking the variances in those cycle times. We use three methods to calculate average in cycle time analysis for this and other projects. These three are the mean, the mode and the median.

The video explains how to calculate manufacturing cycle time averages in these three aforementioned ways. The mean is the one we always associate as average. This simply involves taking all the cycle times in a given sample portion and dividing it by the number of operations or cycle times captured.

The next method of the mode manufacturing cycle time which is simply the cycle time that appears most frequently during the sample portion. Ultimately, the mode is often the one where the work stoppages and downtime are not a factor. As such, it's often the best benchmark for cycle time analysis.

Finally, the median involves re-configuring all the times from lowest to highest and using the following calculation to identify the average time: Median { ( N + 1 ) / 2 } where N is the number of operations. In this case, it's 10 +1 = 11 divided by 2 which is 5.5. Therefore, we isolate the cycle time in-between the 5th and 6th time. 

Finally, all of these cycle times are placed on a graph in order to identify the variances in cycle times and high and low points. The idea is to isolate the root causes of high and low cycle times while putting a plan in motion to eliminate causes of work stoppages.

Z61Uii5K2j8,Improve Operator Efficiency - Manufacturing,"Measuring and improving operator efficiency of machines and equipment on the shopfloor can have a dramatic effect on manufacturing productivity and output.

PlantRun systems can be used to measure, track and analyse individual operator performance and compare the performance of machine operators against time/machine/product etc.. This allows you to identify under performing staff for re-training and to spread the best practices of your most efficient staff thereby improving operator efficiency.

Improved Time Management

Operators starting late, taking extra time during breaks, finishing early and taking longer to restart a machine than they should is a typical scenario in many manufacturing companies.

Even if  this is only arriving at the machine 5 minutes late, starting up 5 minutes later, taking an extra 10 minutes over lunchtime and then finishing 10 minutes early it amounts to 30 minutes in an 8 hour shift equivalent to 6.25%. Without continuous monitoring in place this is often much longer. And this is per machine, if you have 20 machines you are losing 10 man hours per shift!

Maybe you don't think your staff do this, but until you measure breaks accurately you don't really know. For one PlantRun user a ""ten minute"" break period was reduced from 23 minutes down to 13 minutes upon installation of the system!

Increasing Operator Productivity

An example of increased operator productivity comes from a wire fabrication company producing a wide range of goods including roll containers, stillages, pallet converters, dollies, picking trollies and garment rails.

The company employ a core staff of around 100 staff but at peak production times this number can double with low skilled agency staff. The productivity of temporary staff is variable and with a relatively labour intensive production process maximising operator output is vital. All the fabrication machinery is monitored for machine utilization efficiency.

Operators log on to the system at shift start up and the system monitors run time, stop time and reasons for stoppage. By analysing downtime stoppages problems such as extended operator breaks are identified and addressed.

System reports make it easy to identify operators with poor productivity performance for training or replacement.  A typical reported improvement in operator productivity boosted output per shift from 80 to 94 units, an increase of 17.5%.

Improved Motivation

Staff motivation can be improved in two ways.

Firstly, the data collected by the system can be used to keep staff informed of their performance against target production rates either using the keypad terminals or large shopfloor displays.  Goal setting and competition between work groups or cells can significantly improve motivation and output.

Secondly, the awareness that production is being monitored and the understanding that computers can't lie often have a refreshing effect on staff behavioural patterns and bad practices that may have been formed over time. In some cases dramatic improvements in productivity have been recorded before systems have been fully installed, simply from improving operator efficiency.",Manufacturing

kwozInrGog0,Traditional manufacturing of childrens wooden toys in Hrvatsko Zagorje,"UNESCO: Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity - 2009
URL: http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/RL/00233
Description: Villagers along the pilgrimage route to the Marian shrine of Our Lady of the Snow in Marija Bistrica in Hrvatsko Zagorje in northern Croatia developed a technique for traditional manufacturing of childrens wooden toys that has now been handed down for generations. The men in a family take soft willow, lime, beech and maple wood from the region and dry, hew, cut and carve it using traditional tools; the women then apply ecologically-friendly paint in improvisational floral or geometric patterns, painting from imagination. The whistles, horses, cars, tiny furniture, spinning dancers, jumping horses and flapping birds produced today are almost identical to those made more than a century ago  though no two toys are precisely the same, thanks to the handcrafted production process. Popular among both locals and tourists, these toys are sold in parish fairs, markets and specialty shops around the world. They have also evolved with the times and, in addition to the traditional shapes such as horses and carts, new ones representing cars, trucks, airplanes and trains have appeared, reflecting the world surrounding modern-day children. Tiny toy instruments, carefully tuned as they are created, still serve as important components in the musical education of rural children.

WeSOiKYmfOo,Shakar Sazi || Sugar Manufacturing,"A sugar cane mill can refer to a factory that processes sugar cane to produce raw or white sugar. It can also mean the piece of equipment that crushes the sticks of sugar cane to extract the juice.
There are a number of steps in producing raw sugar from cane:

Cane receiving and unloading (receive the cane at the factory and unload it from the transport vehicles)
Cane preparation (cutting and shredding cane to prepare it for juice extraction)
Juice extraction (two technologies are in common use; milling or diffusion)
Juice clarification (remove suspended solids from the juice, typically mud, waxes, fibres)
Juice evaporation (to concentrate the juice to a thick syrup of about 65°brix)
Syrup clarification (remove suspended solids from the syrup, typically colloid syze of mud, waxes, fibres, etc.)
Crystallisation
Centrifugation (Separation of the sugar crystals from the mother liquor, done by centrifugal machines)
Sugar drying
Packaging and delivery
These processing steps will produce a brown or raw sugar. Mill white sugar also known as plantation white sugar can be produced by introducing some form of colour removal process (often sulphitation) between the juice clarification and the juice evaporation stages mentioned above.The raw sugar produced is often refined to produce white sugar. This sugar refining can be done either at a completely separate factory or at a back-end refinery which is attached to the raw sugar factory.

yLjxoscCi0A,The Future of Space:  Off-World Manufacturing | Rob Hoyt | TEDxSnoIsleLibraries,"For Rob Hoyt, the challenges of effectively spreading off-world and colonizing the cosmos are overcome by making it easier to manufacture and assemble large systems and structures in space. This visionary physicist, engineer, and CEO is leading a team of scientists to overcome those challenges.

This talk was given at TEDxSnoIsleLibraries 2016 in Edmonds, Washington. http://www.sno-isle.org/tedx

Rob loves overcoming the big technical hurdles that we face on our way to becoming a spacefaring civilization. He co-founded Tethers Unlimited Inc. in 1994, and built it into a space and defense research and development firm. He is now building a spin-off, Firmamentum, to commercialize in-space manufacturing. Rob has won more grants from NASA’s Innovative Advanced Concepts program than any other researcher.

The Invisalign system is a combination of proprietary virtual modeling software, rapid manufacturing processes and mass customization, and virtually clear, removable appliances or ""aligners"" that are used to straighten teeth.

The Invisalign system is prescribed to patients through trained Invisalign orthodontists or general practitioner dentists (GP dentists). Align provides clinical education programs and the tools needed for orthodontists or GP dentists to offer Invisalign treatment options in their practices. Although treatment time varies by patient, on average a patient requires one full year of treatment - equivalent to 24 sets of Invisalign aligners.

sqCbYd8O8MU,Audi Smart Factory - Future of Audi Production,"Audi Smart Factory P-Tech Day. Subscribe.
Audi is making its production fit for the future with the smart factory. In this factory of the future, big data – the creation and intelligent connection of large volumes of data – will facilitate data‑driven and thus highly flexible and highly efficient manufacturing. A method of production in which Audi might no longer build its cars on an assembly line but according to a radically new, disruptive concept is modular assembly. In addition to this major project, Audi is pursuing many other exciting projects for the production of the future – from the application of virtual‑reality glasses to metal 3D printing.

Modular assembly.
The complexity of automobile production is increasing. New market needs, customer expectations and the legislative framework are increasingly requiring innovative technologies and differing vehicle versions. This means that the fixed timing of the assembly line is becoming less efficient. The more the number of derivatives and variants grows, the more difficult it becomes to master high complexity and integrate new routines into the rigid, sequential process.

Audi intends to meet this challenge and to develop a completely new principle for it: modular assembly. With this method, small, separate workstations allow highly flexible working routines – in terms of both time and space. Between those workstations, driverless transport systems take over the transport of the car bodies as well as the parts required for production. A central computer precisely controls the driverless transport systems – it recognizes the needs of each individual station, thus ensuring a smooth workflow.

Audi assumes that modular assembly will result in 20 percent better productivity than the assembly lines of today. It is now being applied for test purposes at the engine plant in Győr, Hungary, and application is planned in two further projects.

At present, the key principles of this innovative production system are being worked out and tested by “arculus” – a startup company established a few months ago.

The Technical Center for Production Assistance Systems.
The new driverless transport systems required for modular assembly are being created in Audi’s “Technology Development Production Assistance Systems” department. This small department has developed two types of driverless vehicle: One of them moves under control by a computer, the other moves autonomously on a defined route. Three onboard laser scanners allow the driverless transport systems to orient themselves and to recognize and avoid potentially critical situations. Audi developed the navigation software itself. It is based on automotive software and automotive‑software development processes.

The main task of the Technical Center for Production Assistance Systems is to work on new production technologies in early stages of their development. In addition to driverless transport systems, it is also working on four other projects. They comprise safe cooperation between humans and machines when working in the same space, assembly tables with assistance functions and two innovative robots: a flexible gripper arm and a special lightweight robot.

The Audi Production Lab.
The Audi Production Lab, abbreviated as P‑Lab, develops and supports innovative projects for the production process – often starting with the very first idea. The department currently has five permanent employees andhas already helped to bring innovations such as metal 3D printing, human‑robot cooperation, driverless transport systems and the use of augmented reality at Audi towards series application.

The projects currently running in the P‑Lab include two big‑data projects. One of them focuses on the early recognition of mistakes in the placement of screws and bolts; the other examines the flow of components in the area of international logistics for the CKD plants (completely knocked down). Another major subject for the Audi Production Lab is data glasses. They can provide effective support for employees in production, for the planners and engineers in the factory of the future – with assisted reality, augmented reality and virtual reality.

Toolmaking.
Several future-oriented projects are running in Audi’s Toolmaking division. The structure of the new generation of press tools follows nature, with many parts made of aluminum and plastics. This reduces the weight of those tools, which until now has been up to 45 tons, by up to 20 percent and the energy required decreases by about ten percent. The result is enhanced precision in the forming of sheet‑metal parts.

The press shop, where the tools are applied, uses the latest measuring technology. The goal is to develop a complete data chain for each sheet‑metal part. The data chain already begins with the suppliers of steel and aluminum. This is another way in which Audi is enhancing its precision.",Manufacturing

Polystar is a professional manufacturer of Plastic bag manufacturing process. We design and manufacture Plastic bag manufacturing process based on every customer's requirement. Polystar Taiwan produces various Plastic bag manufacturing process both of Plastic recycling machine and Blown film extruder.

The Plastic bag manufacturing process is using recycled pellets to make films and bags. During the Plastic bag manufacturing process, recycling machine produces reusable pellets, which can be put directly back to the Plastic bag manufacturing process. Recycled pellet from post-consumer film can be reused into Plastic bag manufacturing process. The film roll produced by Blown film extruder is used on Plastic bag manufacturing process.

Recycled pellets from in-house waste for Plastic bag manufacturing process are almost like-new and can be re-used for producing high quality plastic products once again in Plastic bag manufacturing process. Pellets from post-consumer recycling are also suitable for Plastic bag manufacturing process. 

The Plastic bag manufacturing process helps to save cost for buying raw material. Especially in three layer co-extruder, the middle layer is composed of recycled pellets in Plastic bag manufacturing process. As a result, we not only produce high resistant multi-layer film but meanwhile save raw material cost for Plastic bag manufacturing process.

DhuuOWteelc,Project Tinkertoy (IC Precursor) 1953 US Navy; Automated Manufacturing of Modular Electronics,"Support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/jeffquitney

Electronics playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAA9B0175C3E15B47

more at: http://scitech.quickfound.net

Project Tinkertoy was an effort begun in 1950 by the US National Bureau of Standards to devise a system for automated manufacturing of electronic devices built up from modular subsystem components. The resulting products were not smaller or lighter than hand-assembled electronics of the time, but were thought to be more reliable and required less skilled labor. The basic unit for circuit construction was a ceramic ""wafer"" upon which the machine produced circuit components were mounted.

Originally a public domain film from the US Navy, slightly cropped to remove uneven edges, with the aspect ratio corrected, and one-pass brightness-contrast-color correction & mild video noise reduction applied.
The soundtrack was also processed with volume normalization, noise reduction, clipping reduction, and/or equalization (the resulting sound, though not perfect, is far less noisy than the original).

Tinkertoy Modulization of Electronic Circuits by Harold Belmont Price (1953) https://archive.org/details/tinkertoymoduliz00pric

...The National Bureau of Standards during World War II developed 
printed circuits to permit rapid production of VT proximity fuzes 
which were required in large numbers for use in gun projectiles. With the methods used in this development it was found that the percentage yield of acceptable circuits was undesirably low where several lumped components were printed as part of the circuit. To partially offset this shortcoming adhesive tape resistors... were developed. Many different printed circuit techniques have been used since information concerning the VT fuze development was first released in February of 1946...

...with the exception of the Sargrove venture in producing a relatively simple circuit no attempt has been made to completly machine produce an equipment from bulk or slightly machined materials. The Bureau of Aeronautics became aware of the possibilities of developing such a system and in June 1950 inaugurated the Tinkertoy project as an Industry Preparedness Measure Project...

The system developed for use in Tinkertoy makes use of ceramic 
wafers upon which the machine produced circuit components are mounted. Riser wires are soldered to notches in the wafer edges for holding the wafers in parallel stacks and for providing electrical connections required to the various components. Each module, as the stacks of wafers are called, generally includes the vacuum tube and associated circuitry required by one stage of the circuit. The modules are secured between top and bottom baseplates which are etched with the necessary circuitry for connecting the modules electrically. The Tinkertoy system at present is limited to production of these plate assemblies which in general contain the circuitry of functional subassemblies. A complete equipment will usually contain several plate assemblies plus mechanical parts and any conventional components 
which are not adaptable to modulization...

The circuit components are mounted on the modular wafers which are the key to the Tinkertoy system of construction. The wafer is a square ceramic plate which is about seven-eighths of an inch on a side and about one-sixteenth of an inch thick. Three equally spaced notches on each edge are designed to receive the riser wires which are soldered to the wafer in assembly of the module. A fourth notch placed between two of the riser wire notches on one edge is provided for use in indexing the wafers to the correct orientation during the assembling processes...",Manufacturing

#NAME?,Traditional Enamel Dial Manufacturing,"Dials made of enamel can last forever, have a great smooth aspect, are prestigious because of their very artisenal production process and have existed since the 17th century. We find them today in historical pieces visible in museums. This technique was used until the beginning of the 20th century. Then metal dials replaced them because it became possible to add colorful decorations. Since then, enamel has used mostly been used on exclusive watches. 

Enamel is composed of glass powder extracted from silica. We don’t produce enamel powder ourselves; we buy it from companies mostly based in France, the United Kingdom, and the United-States. They contain metal oxides that give different colors to the substance, essentially added to transparent enamels. The whiteness and opacity of the white enamel dial comes from the breakdown of arsenic. But today, there is no substitute for obtaining the whiteness we have on our dials, for instance. We work following the same traditional method used before.

This starts with a disc made out of copper. This precise metal is used because of its maneuverability. It allows us to create dials with different shapes, both domed and flat. First, we weld feet to the back of the disc. Then we heat the dial to about 950°C to relax the metal. The process continues by cleaning it and scrubbing it to reintroduce some tension. Thus, the piece remains solid during the next operations. The first layers of enamel are put on the back and front of the dial at the same time by dusting enamel powder before putting it in the kiln for the first time. The back layer is necessary as every new one added on the front adds tension to the metal. Without it, the dial would bend and finally break.

A dial made out of enamel is like gold: timeless.",Manufacturing

J4qwK1KgL_s,Philippines: Cebu Province: Illegal Gun-Manufacturing Centre - 1997,"Cebu province in the Philippines is known for its beautiful beaches and resorts.

But Cebu is known to Filipinos for its illegal gun-manufacturing centred in the city of  Danao.

Recently, the government has approved licences for two gun manufacturing companies  in Danao.

But some remain in operation even without a permit, and this is likely to continue.

UPSOUND: (Sound of rapid gunfire from Uzi-gram)

Byron Garcia is testing what he calls an ""uzi-gram"".

It's one of the products being manufactured by the Danao Arms Manufacturing  Corporation, or Damcor - the first licensed gun manufacturer in Danao City.

The city of Danao, in the Philippine central island of Cebu, has always been notorious  as the centre of illegal gun manufacturing.

Here, thousands of residents have been involved for decades in what is virtually  considered a cottage industry, making home-made guns, popularly known as ""paltik"".

By establishing Damcor, Garcia has legalised gun manufacturing in Danao. 

Damcor specialises on the 38-revolver, and is also producing machine pistols and  shotguns mainly to supply the country's security agencies.

Garcia has invested more than 40 (m) million pesos in Damcor, some of which were  spent on machines with state of the art  technology to produce some of the gun parts.

But most of the work is left for the 70 workers that Garcia has employed since his  company opened last year.

Most of their experience is based on what they've been clandestinely doing in their  backyard for years.

30-year old Lito Gonzales was into illegal gun making for ten years before he decided to  work for Damcor.  

Here, he earns about 600-dollars a month, and is free from the anxiety of being arrested  by the authorities.

SOUNDBITE: (Tagalog) 
""Now, we're okay here, because we don't need to worry about being arrested today or  tomorrow, that the police will arrest us because it's illegal to do guns outside. No  more.""
SUPER CAPTION:  Lito Gonzales, worker Danao Arms Manufacturing Corporation

But despite the entry of Damcor and another licensed gun company, Garcia believes  that the illegal gun- manufacturing industry in Danao will continue to flourish, mainly  because of the lack of political will to remove it.

SOUNDBITE:  (English) 
""Maybe it will change a bit. But it cannot totally eradicate the illegal business here.""
SUPER CAPTION:  Byron Garcia, President Danao Arms Manufacturing Corporation

And for most of the illegal gun makers in this city, making the ""paltik"" in their  backyards will surely be a hard habit to break.

For 20-year-old Julius Capuyan, it's the only job he's known since he was 13 years old.

SOUNDBITE:  (Tagalog) 
""There's no other way of life for us here. We'd rather live this way, illegally making guns.
SUPER CAPTION:  Julius Capuyan

Most of the people in Danao have relied on this illegal industry as their livelihood for  decades making the government's job of curbing the unlicensed gun-manufacturing  operations a difficult task.

sqCbYd8O8MU,Audi Smart Factory - Future of Audi Production,"Audi Smart Factory P-Tech Day. Subscribe.
Audi is making its production fit for the future with the smart factory. In this factory of the future, big data – the creation and intelligent connection of large volumes of data – will facilitate data‑driven and thus highly flexible and highly efficient manufacturing. A method of production in which Audi might no longer build its cars on an assembly line but according to a radically new, disruptive concept is modular assembly. In addition to this major project, Audi is pursuing many other exciting projects for the production of the future – from the application of virtual‑reality glasses to metal 3D printing.

Modular assembly.
The complexity of automobile production is increasing. New market needs, customer expectations and the legislative framework are increasingly requiring innovative technologies and differing vehicle versions. This means that the fixed timing of the assembly line is becoming less efficient. The more the number of derivatives and variants grows, the more difficult it becomes to master high complexity and integrate new routines into the rigid, sequential process.

Audi intends to meet this challenge and to develop a completely new principle for it: modular assembly. With this method, small, separate workstations allow highly flexible working routines – in terms of both time and space. Between those workstations, driverless transport systems take over the transport of the car bodies as well as the parts required for production. A central computer precisely controls the driverless transport systems – it recognizes the needs of each individual station, thus ensuring a smooth workflow.

Audi assumes that modular assembly will result in 20 percent better productivity than the assembly lines of today. It is now being applied for test purposes at the engine plant in Győr, Hungary, and application is planned in two further projects.

At present, the key principles of this innovative production system are being worked out and tested by “arculus” – a startup company established a few months ago.

The Technical Center for Production Assistance Systems.
The new driverless transport systems required for modular assembly are being created in Audi’s “Technology Development Production Assistance Systems” department. This small department has developed two types of driverless vehicle: One of them moves under control by a computer, the other moves autonomously on a defined route. Three onboard laser scanners allow the driverless transport systems to orient themselves and to recognize and avoid potentially critical situations. Audi developed the navigation software itself. It is based on automotive software and automotive‑software development processes.

The main task of the Technical Center for Production Assistance Systems is to work on new production technologies in early stages of their development. In addition to driverless transport systems, it is also working on four other projects. They comprise safe cooperation between humans and machines when working in the same space, assembly tables with assistance functions and two innovative robots: a flexible gripper arm and a special lightweight robot.

The Audi Production Lab.
The Audi Production Lab, abbreviated as P‑Lab, develops and supports innovative projects for the production process – often starting with the very first idea. The department currently has five permanent employees andhas already helped to bring innovations such as metal 3D printing, human‑robot cooperation, driverless transport systems and the use of augmented reality at Audi towards series application.

The projects currently running in the P‑Lab include two big‑data projects. One of them focuses on the early recognition of mistakes in the placement of screws and bolts; the other examines the flow of components in the area of international logistics for the CKD plants (completely knocked down). Another major subject for the Audi Production Lab is data glasses. They can provide effective support for employees in production, for the planners and engineers in the factory of the future – with assisted reality, augmented reality and virtual reality.

Toolmaking.
Several future-oriented projects are running in Audi’s Toolmaking division. The structure of the new generation of press tools follows nature, with many parts made of aluminum and plastics. This reduces the weight of those tools, which until now has been up to 45 tons, by up to 20 percent and the energy required decreases by about ten percent. The result is enhanced precision in the forming of sheet‑metal parts.

The press shop, where the tools are applied, uses the latest measuring technology. The goal is to develop a complete data chain for each sheet‑metal part. The data chain already begins with the suppliers of steel and aluminum. This is another way in which Audi is enhancing its precision.",Manufacturing

In this video Stefan shows you step by step how to find wholesale suppliers and manufacturers to private label a product and sell on Amazon.

""This is a very important step of this process because once you found a product that you want to sell or a niche or an opportunity that you want to sell on Amazon that you already deemed as profitable that you can make money from then the supplier piece is the next most important part.

You want to make sure that you find suppliers that have good prices, that will give you a great quote, that you can negotiate with and build a great relationship with, that you can order a certain number of units from, maybe a product from China or the United States. 

I will be showing you exactly how to do that.""

Grab yourself a brew, sit back and watch this enchanting video of a Rover motorcycle being constructed back in the good old days of hand crafted machinery.  From casting the cylinders to machining the crank and assembling the engine, this a wonderful insight into the vintage days of building motorcycles for the road.  And keep your eye out for the test rider who hits the water feature with a little bit too much gusto!

The Rover company began to develop and produced the Rover Imperial motorcycle in November 1902. This was a 3.5hp diamond-framed motorcycle with the engine in the centre and 'springer' front forks, an improvement ahead of its time. The first Rover motorcycle had innovative features such as a spray carburettor, a bottom-bracket engine, and mechanically operated valves. Featuring a strong frame with double front down tubes and a good quality finish, over a thousand Rover motorcycles were sold in 1904.

jAInt7hIZlU,The Making of a Steinway - A Steinway &amp; Sons Factory Tour Narrated by John Steinway,"The making of a Steinway piano is a time-honored process involving the hands of many skilled craftspeople over the course of almost a full year. Steinway & Sons pianos are built in just two factories worldwide - one in Astoria, NY and one in Hamburg, Germany. Both factories have been building pianos for well over a century, and although Steinway has always been at the cutting edge in utilizing and perfecting the latest technology where it could make the piano better, we have found that certain things are simply better when done by skilled craftspeople than by a machine. For that reason, many parts of the process in building a Steinway have remained essentially unchanged for generations. So much so, that we were able to take decades-old audio from a narrated factory tour by the late John H. Steinway (great-grandson of Henry E. Steinway, who founded our great company in 1853) and use it as the narration for footage shot at the Steinway NY factory in 2011 by Ben Niles, producer of the documentary film ""Note by Note"" (http://www.notebynotethemovie.com). 

We hope you enjoy this look inside the Steinway New York factory, narrated in detail by the late, great John Steinway.

YyrR9EwhFcQ,Brexit Impact on Manufacturing | Womble Bond Dickinson,"Hear from Womble Bond Dickinson's Malcolm Dowden on what impact Brexit could have on the manufacturing business.

Transcript:
 Another sector that is under urgent pressure to adapt to Brexit is the manufacturing sector.  And a particular problem for manufacturing is that current production methods, current distribution of the stages of production, are very largely based on the EU single market.  We quite commonly for example see automobile manufacturers having parts of a vehicle built in one EU jurisdiction, other stages of the process are being carried out elsewhere in the EU finishing yet in another jurisdiction and then the finished product being distributed as a part of the single market through the EU.  Post-Brexit that integrated manufacturing process has to be rethought.  And it doesn’t necessarily mean that those processes can’t carry on in the locations that are currently used.  It does mean, however, that we as advisors need to need to help clients to have a much clearer view of the specific reliefs facilitations and other measures that they should be applying for.  For example, tariff impacts customs beauties can be mitigated or eliminated by applying for reliefs like inward processing relief.  We are working with clients and governmental authorities in the UK to explore the potential for structures like free ports or free zones to address those sectoral impacts.  And we’re even looking with parts of UK government revenue and customs in particular at the scope for developing technology based virtual free zones that would allow elements of the manufacturing process to be traced through the process rather than being looked at on a geographical basis.  So customs facilitations and reliefs would apply as long as those components are verifiably within the same production lines and production process rather than applying only because they are within a defined geographic free zone.  Now that’s a live discussion and it’s also something that’s driving some innovative and creative investment which I think is a useful indication that Brexit as well as being a challenge can also be an accelerator.  It can be an impulse for innovation.  So I don’t think it’s all doom and gloom, particularly not for the manufacturing sector which has in any event been making huge strides in terms of the adoption of inter matter things technology, block change distributor ledger, and other related innovations.  So that’s where I think the manufacturing sectors focus of attention should be and in fact is.",Manufacturing

xyAH5LGMQhs,Stabilized Insoluble Sulfur Manufacturing Business,"Stabilized Insoluble Sulfur Manufacturing Business. Production of Insoluble Sulphur Stabilizing Agent
Insoluble sulfur (IS) is a type of sulfur polymer, which is insoluble in CS2 and is a good rubber vulcanizing agent [1-4]. There are two types of IS, oil-filled and non-oil-filled. The production of IS usually adopts a high temperature method, which causes the liquid or gas sulfur to spray into cold liquids to obtain IS with a concentration of 30-60wt%. To obtain high concentrations of IS, solvent has been used to extract the soluble sulfur, followed by filling with oil to obtain oil-filled IS [2, 7-11].
Insoluble sulfur is an important rubber additive agent. It improves product quality, wearability and resistance to both fatigue and ageing. In addition to being universally recognized as the best vulcanizing agent, it is widely used in the manufacture of tire, rubber pipe, shoes, cable and wire insulating materials, latex, all kinds of automobile rubber parts and is also a necessary component of belt tires. Therefore, due to its non-blooming characteristic, insoluble sulfur is widely used in the manufacture of radial rubber and other synthetic rubber products, also in the light-colored rubber products in which common sulfur is incorporated in high proportion.

y0GbNwKmHaE,MANUFACTURING GUILT - A Short Film About Mumia Abu-Jamal&#39;s Case,"""Wow, masterful work! This piece broaches new ground in a number of areas... It is easily absorbed by the uninitiated and illuminating.""-- Linn Washington, Journalist, Philadelphia Tribune

MANUFACTURING GUILT is a short film that appears as a Bonus Feature on our dvd MUMIA: LONG DISTANCE REVOLUTIONARY (www.firstrunfeatures.com/mumiadvd.html).  The short takes on the colossus of Abu-Jamal's contentious case, distilling a mountain of evidence and years of oft-repeated falsehoods to the most fundamental elements of police and prosecutorial misconduct that illustrate a clear and conscious effort to frame Mumia Abu-Jamal for the murder of patrolman Daniel Faulkner. 

Based on the actual record of investigations and court filings from 1995 to 2003 - evidence denied by the courts and ignored in the press - MANUFACTURING GUILT cuts through the years of absurdities and overt racism to produce a clear picture of how Abu-Jamal's guilt was manufactured and his innocence suppressed beginning only moments after he and Faulkner were found shot in the early morning hours of December 9th, 1981. This historic and courageous film is the perfect companion to Long Distance Revolutionary - a film that is unequivocal in its force regarding Abu-Jamal's innocence.

""A chilling and vital inside view."" --Jamal Hart (Mumia's eldest son)

""Excellent and concise piece of film journalism""--Trust Movies

""Terrific! Focuses on the actual crime, with lots of specific information, going point by point over everything that is known, including a journalist's photos of the crime scene (those are amazing, by the way)... all of the questions I had (about the case) are answered in the short. So be sure to watch.""--Pop Culture Beast

L3CkzQQFZXs,Additive Manufacturing - LASERTEC 65 3D,"The unique combination of laser deposition welding with a powder nozzle and milling on the LASERTEC 65 3D, is an innovative generative machining method. It allows a faster production of complex geometries and individual 3D-parts. Especially large components up to Ø 500 mm can be produced cost-effectively with this hybrid solution. The flexible changeover between laser and milling operations enables the direct machining of areas that can no longer be reached later on the finished part. The laser process uses a metal powder feed, which allows the additive manufacture of parts without a processing chamber nor the need for a supporting structures. The additive process is up to 10 times faster than the generation in a powder bed. DMG MORI is offering the complete process chain, starting with the NC-programming in the hybrid CAD / CAM system, via the usage of proven technology parameters coming from a material data base, through to machining operations, process monitoring and documentation.",Manufacturing
Kslh8XUphJo,IACMI Wind Blade Prototype (Composites Manufacturing Innovation),"Knoxville, TN, January 31, 2017— The Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation (IACMI) unveiled an advanced technology prototype wind blade during the Winter IACMI members meeting February 1-2 in Denver, Colorado. The nine- meter long blade was fabricated at IACMI’s Wind Technology Area in the Denver, Colorado area. Commercialization of the wind blade prototype created could speed production times, reduce manufacture cost, and provide stronger, more energy-efficient blades for the United States.

A large team of eleven industrial partners, including Arkema Inc., Johns Manville, TPI Composites Inc., Huntsman Polyurethanes, Strongwell, DowAksa USA, Chomarat North America, Composites One, SikaAxson, Creative Foam and Chem-Trend, provided materials and on site fabrication support for blade component manufacturing and assembly. Pultruded spar caps were fabricated at Strongwell in Bristol, Virginia and shipped to Colorado for incorporation into the blade shells. The project was led by IACMI’s Wind Technology Area, based in the Denver, Colorado area , with support from IACMI Headquarters, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Manufacturing Office, and the Advanced Industries Program administered by the Colorado Office of Economic Trade and Development (OEDIT).

The prototype blade is based on an existing design from previous work conducted by the DOE, representing a small-scale version of a utility-scale multi-megawatt blade. The new blade, molded on tooling supplied by TPI Composites, Inc., features innovations such as impact resistant components, continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic parts and exterior shell components produced with less than half the normal CO2 emissions commonly emitted in wind blade manufacture.",Manufacturing

pf-tQYcZGM4,📺 Noam Chomsky&#39;s Manufacturing Consent revisited | The Listening Post,"There is an exquisite and oft-quoted moment in an interview between BBC journalist Andrew Marr and Noam Chomsky in which Marr asks: ""How can you know that I'm self-censoring?"".

""I'm not saying you're self censoring. I'm sure you believe everything you're saying. But what I'm saying is that if you believed something different, you wouldn't be sitting where you're sitting.""

Wry as ever, Chomsky exposed the slightly delusional pretensions of the journalistic establishment - and not far behind, the complicities of the media industry with political power.

Harsh? Perhaps. True? All too often.

For many of us who work at The Listening Post, Chomsky's ideas on the media in Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media have provided us with a guide, full of cautionary tales and ideas that are still controversial to this day.

The book was published in 1988 - a year before the end of the Cold War when it was announced that western liberal democracy had triumphed, heralding the end of ideology, authoritarianism, and propaganda.

In the past 30 years, we have seen the mass communications industry multiply, providing an illusion of choice, echoing the rhetorics of freedom - of press, of expression - but not necessarily yielding the pluralism liberal democracies had promised.

In that way, the book continues to resonate.

But like all revered texts, Manufacturing Consent also calls upon us as active readers, journalists, citizens to interrogate its premises. Does the book's denunciatory tone risk overstate the power of the media establishment? Does it underestimate the critical faculties of the public? Is the media so homogenous an entity that power can be wielded top-down? Where are the lapses, the blind spots? Where do journalists find pockets of power that serve to disrupt?

We spoke to three journalists who have their careers being disruptive and asked them about the ideas that had influenced them in Chomsky and Herman's book: Matt Taibbi, whose reporting for Rolling Stone has provided one of the most critical accounts of US political history in recent years; Indian editor-in-chief Aman Sethi who questions the premises of Chomsky's book and Amira Hass, the Haaretz correspondent for the Occupied Territories.

The first thing we asked Hass was what she thought about Chomsky's statement: ""the general population doesn't know what's happening, and it doesn't even know that it doesn't know"".

""This is a very humanist and optimistic statement,"" she responded. ""The belief that when people are informed they may act, things may change. In Hebrew, the words knowledge and awareness are all made of the same root. Yedda and Mudaoot. And so awareness is connected to Mudaoot in Hebrew. And this is how I started working in Gaza, aware that the Israeli public knows nothing about the occupation and what it means. But the people do not pick up this information. They have access to it but they choose not to access it.""

Hass has been covering Palestine for the best part of 30 years - in that time, sources of information have multiplied, but public outrage?

""Today we have so much access to information in other ways that we are on a collision with the fact that people are not interested in what does not serve immediately their interest,"" she said, with resignation, ""and this is a very sad realisation.""

Aman Sethi put it like this:

""It's easy to say that people believe what they believe because their consent has been manufactured. But what if people know exactly what's going on and still believe what they believe, right? Then that's terrifying.""

ojj5J6oPwXo,GONZO: Manufacturing American dreams (E1),"As the USA descends into hyper-partisan civil war in which weaponized memes and hashtags are lobbed across political party lines, GONZO heads to Hollywood – ground zero for the new culture wars. This is also where the myth of the American Dream is engineered, and where all her superheroes save the world. Max and Stacy meet with photographer, Peter Duke, who has been branded ‘alt-right’ by the mainstream media. They ask him about the power of memes to alter the course of history. Did a racist cartoon frog emerging from the darkest recesses of online chat boards really help defeat ‘the most qualified’ presidential candidate in US history?

Max and Stacy also talk to a Hollywood screenwriter about which feature film characters best capture the essence of modern America, and about the real violence that is part of our DNA, from slavery to genocide of the native population. Max and Stacy also find Donald Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, because – of course – it is Hollywood itself that created the myth that is the straight-talking, successful billionaire real-estate developer and builder for whom many voted to become president of the United States of America. The GONZO journey begins!

URL: http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/USL/01065
Description: The Portuguese cowbell is a traditional idiophone percussion instrument that provides an unmistakable soundscape in rural areas. Alcáçovas is the main manufacturing centre where the cowbells, traditionally used by shepherds to manage livestock, are made. The practice is transmitted from father to son and requires a series of processes before the handmade iron pieces are polished and fine-tuned. Yet the tradition is becoming unsustainable as new grazing methods, cheaper industrial techniques and fewer cowbell makers are leading to its demise.

tTWIIhKI8cA,How to Design and Manufacture a Product,"It can be quite a challenge to find a manufacturer -- one you like working with and whose factory produces a quality product at a fair price. Here are some tips on how to navigate through the process of finding one, as well as how to optimize your relationship with your manufacturer so that you -- and your customers -- are happy. For more infor visit: http://www.focuspdm.com/


Step 1: Creating a Prototype

Creating a working prototype or finding someone who can do it for you is the first step in the manufacturing process. During my early days, I was able to sew most of my prototypes. But as my product, Planecomfort, was refined and the components used and the skills necessary to create the product I envisioned moved beyond my sewing expertise, I knew I needed help. Searching online, I found a wonderful yet small cut-and-sew business in northern California called Left in Stitches.
This relationship proved valuable to me in a number of ways. They not only helped refine my original prototype, but they offered many suggestions and ideas for making the product easier to manufacture. Many of these smaller domestic companies offer prototyping services that are invaluable to new entrepreneurs.
Once you have a prototype, there is quality and design testing and tweaking. At each stage of development, and every time I received the newer version of my product, I washed, dried, pulled, stretched, zipped, unzipped, and put my product through the proverbial ""ringer."" Making sure your product will exceed your customers' expectations is a sure way to keep them coming back and referring your product to others.
Ideally, you want to have a dozen or so finished prototypes. Manufacturers will want one or two samples sent to them as a reference to compare to the finished product their factory is making.
I thought I would be able to use Left in Stitches for the long term, but due to logistical reasons and production costs, I had to find an overseas manufacturer. Moving your manufacturing operations overseas means you want large quantities (usually thousands) of the item you are producing. If you want hundreds of something, you may be better off working with a domestic manufacturer.
Step 2: Finding a Manufacturer

I located my overseas manufacturers through referrals, which provided me with an immediate level of comfort and confidence with these factories. One referral came from a fabric manufacturer. Most fabric manufacturers have relationships with product manufacturers.
Another factory was referred to me by a marketing services company. This company manufactures both soft and hard goods and was happy to provide their contact with another business opportunity. Call domestic manufacturers and inquire about their overseas connections. Ask everyone you know if they know someone who manufactures the type of products you are creating. Search online for companies with products similar to yours and call them. Who do they use? How did they get started? My experience is that most people will want to help you.
I found it was best to work with at least two different companies when trying to decide who will win your business. Who is easiest to work with? Who meets (or beats) your expectations? Is one more knowledgeable than the other? Having a comparison is essential to ensure you are getting a quality product at a fair price.
There are two common ways you can deal with overseas manufacturing. You can find a broker or agent in the U.S. that represents the factory, or deal with a factory directly.

Once you have determined who you might like to work with, you must check references on your contact and the factory. Some of the important questions to ask:
Was the product made to specifications?
What percentage of the shipment was defective?
If there was a problem with the shipment, did the factory make restitution?
Were deadlines met? If not, what did the factory offer to make amends?
Is what was promised delivered?
How is the quality of goods they produce?
How long have you worked with this person and factory?
How many orders have you placed?
Is your contact easy to work with?
Is he/she responsive to calls and emails?
What type of projects does the factory excel in producing? Soft goods, hard goods?
What types of companies do they normally work with?
Who is responsible for landing the goods in the U.S.?

A 5 axis laser metal deposition manufacturing method is being developed by TWI for an EU-funded project which is demonstrating  drastic time reduction in the manufacture of aero engine casings.

In LMD, a weld track is formed using metal powder as a filler material which is fed, through a coaxial nozzle, to a melt pool created by a focused high-power laser beam. By traversing both the nozzle and laser, a new material layer develops with precise accuracy and user-defined properties.

C&EN Senior Correspondent Jean-François Tremblay went inside Cipla's advanced pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing plant to learn more about the stringent regulations it must follow. India's future as the world's drugstore is a controversial topic. Other drugmakers have been heavily fined, or had products recalled or banned, because of problems at plants. And India is under pressure to make its patent system more like those in western nations. But India has found a market for low-cost drugs and that market isn't about to disappear.

N-HoLI9hO0c,Top 10 3D-Printed Cars - the Future of Auto Manufacturing,"3d printing is one of those disruptive technologies that might reshape our future. It is cheap, it is fast and environmentally friendly. 

While NASA plans to use 3d printers on long space missions, auto manufacturers intend to solve some more grounded tasks, like speeding up car manufacturing process, building durable and light bodies and decreasing the number of auto parts altogether. Take a glimpse at the first 10 3d printed cars that will stay in the history books forever. Enjoy the ride.

Light cocoon – Edag: www.edag.de/en/edag/press-media/picture-archive/concept-cars.html
The German engineering company EDAG is quite ambitious to say the least, as it is set on changing the way cars are being built today. Light Cocoon is a follow up to the Genesis that was this company’s first attempts to create a 3d printed Auto body. The outer shell of the Cocoon is made of durable water resistant ultra thin fabric that is drawn over the 3d printed body made of polymer. The outfit for this car was designed in cooperation with the famous German manufacturer of sport clothes jack Wolfskin. 

Soulmate – Edag: www.edag.de/en/edag/press-media/picture-archive/concept-cars.html
Soulmate is the latest development from Edag that was introduced in 2016. This car concept was designed in cooperation with the German company Bosch, and resulted in the creation of incredibly beautiful lightweight car with features of connected mobility. The outer shell of Soulmate reminds us about the earlier prototype of the company – Light Cocoon. 

Strati - Local Motors: localmotors.com/strati/
This is the world’s first 3d printed electric car. Strati was created as a partnership project between Local motors and Oak Ridge National Lab. It took 44 hours to print this car and it consists from roughly 227 layers and 50 main parts, which is much less in comparison to 6,000 parts of traditional autos. Fully recyclable black ABS plastic reinforced with carbon fibers was used as the building material for Strati and the only not printed parts are the motor, battery, power train, tires and wheels. 

LM 3d Swim - Local Motors: launchforth.io/localmotors/road-ready-3d-printed-car/explore/
LM3D is a street legal 4 seater, which parts are 75% printed by the use of Big Area additive manufacturing technology. This model is made from a blend of 80% recyclable ABS plastic and 20% carbon fiber., however Local Motors are trying to test new compounds in order to create a viable manufacturing process to print 90% of a car. 

Blade - Divergent3D: www.divergent3d.com/
The Blade is the first supercar in the world to be built by the use of a 3d printing technology. This auto was build by the use of a patented Node technology, when 3d printed aluminum parts connect carbon fiber tubes, to enhance durability of the chassis. 

Lotus 340r – 3D replica: www.buildparts.com/idea-center/lotus
But companies like C.ideas is using 3d scanning and printing technologies to give new lives to limited edition autos like 1999 Lotus 340r. More than 40 components were produced for this four wheeler that came out in a very small volume of 340.

Nanyang Venture 8: www.mae.ntu.edu.sg/Programmes/CurrentStudents/UG(Full-Time)/PDC/NVCars/Pages/NVVIII.aspx
This is a 4-wheel concept electric micro car that was designed for a competition sponsored by Shell corporation Eco marathon in 2015. Students from College of Engineering from Nanyang Technological University were determined to demonstrate the feasibility of use of the emerging 3d printing technology in making such large objects as cars. 

URBEE 2: korecologic.com/
Kor Ecologic is the company of enthusiast who funded their prohect of the greenest automobile in the world through Kickstarter. The engineers are especially worried about the condition of our environment and the fact that the number of cars will increase to 2.5 billion by the year 2050 and if the number of emissions doesn’t go down it will inevitably cause a global catastrophe. 

Honda Micro Commuter: hondanews.eu/gb/en/cars/media/pressreleases/81491/honda-and-kabuku-inc-unveil-3d-printed-micro-commuter-vehicle-at-ceatec
This tiny car was presented by Honda in 2016 and is the first 3d printed auto from this manufacturer. It has the name Micro commuter and it was produced for Toshiyama, a Japanese company that makes cookies and actually plans to put the car to use. Honda cooperated with the 3d Printing startup Kabuku inc and the total development process took about two months. 

Shelby Cobra – 3d replica: web.ornl.gov/sci/manufacturing/media/news/detroit-show/
This iconic for the history of the American Automobile industry car was built by the US Department of Energy to demonstrate the abilities of efficient modern 3d printing technologies and popularize low emission driving.

kusAX4Th4N8,Manufacturing Consent: Thought Control in a Democratic Society - Noam Chomsky,"Walter Lippmann (23 September 1889 -- 14 December 1974) was an American public intellectual, writer, reporter, and political commentator famous for being among the first to introduce the concept of Cold War. More Chomsky: https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&tag=tra0c7-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=685da0c9f3d6ee8085f8c084206f56c8&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=books&keywords=chomsky

Lippmann was twice awarded (1958 and 1962) a Pulitzer Prize for his syndicated newspaper column, ""Today and Tomorrow"".

Edward Louis Bernays (November 22, 1891 -- March 9, 1995), was an Austrian-American pioneer in the field of public relations and propaganda, referred to in his obituary as ""the father of public relations."" He combined the ideas of Gustave Le Bon and Wilfred Trotter on crowd psychology with the psychoanalytical ideas of his uncle, Sigmund Freud.

He felt this manipulation was necessary in society, which he regarded as irrational and dangerous as a result of the 'herd instinct' that Trotter had described. Adam Curtis's award-winning 2002 documentary for the BBC, The Century of the Self, pinpoints Bernays as the originator of modern public relations, and Bernays was named one of the 100 most influential Americans of the 20th century by Life magazine.

Harold Dwight Lasswell (February 13, 1902 — December 18, 1978) was a leading American political scientist and communications theorist. He was a member of the Chicago school of sociology and was a professor at Yale University in law. He was a President of the American Political Science Association (APSA) and World Academy of Art and Science (WAAS). According to a biographical memorial written by Gabriel Almond at the time of Lasswell's death and published by the National Academies of Sciences in 1987, Lasswell ""ranked among the half dozen creative innovators in the social sciences in the twentieth century."" At the time, Almond asserted that ""few would question that he was the most original and productive political scientist of his time."" Areas of research in which Lasswell worked included the importance of personality, social structure, and culture in the explanation of political phenomena. He was noted to be ahead of his time in employing a variety of methodological approaches that later became standards across a variety of intellectual traditions including interviewing techniques, content analysis, para-experimental techniques, and statistical measurement.

The Committee on Public Information, also known as the CPI or the Creel Committee, was an independent agency of the government of the United States created to influence U.S. public opinion regarding American participation in World War I. Over just 28 months, from April 13, 1917, to August 21, 1919, it used every medium available to create enthusiasm for the war effort and enlist public support against foreign attempts to undercut America's war aims.

Save time and money on the production of large-scale, high-value metal (titanium, tantalum, inconel, stainless steel, etc.) parts and prototypes with Sciaky's Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing (EBAM™) solution.

Transcript:

Imagine: From this, to this, in a fraction of the time and cost it used to take. With Sciaky’s exclusive Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing, or EBAM™ for short, metal 3D printing is not limited by part size, material, or geometry. You can manufacture parts and structures that exceed 19 feet in length, 4 feet wide, 4 feet high, and 8 feet in diameter, made from virtually any metal, including inconel and stainless steels, and refractory alloys like titanium and tantalum.  

How does the EBAM™ process work? Starting with a 3D model from a CAD program, Sciaky’s fully-articulated, moving electron beam gun deposits metal, from wire feedstock, layer by layer, until the part reaches near-net shape and is ready for finish machining. Deposition rates can range from 7 to 20 pounds of metal per hour, which is significantly more efficient and cost-effective than selective laser sintering processes that utilize messy powders. In addition, a dual wire-feed system can be utilized with the EBAM™ process to increase deposition efficiency, as well as to easily switch to different deposition materials. 

So, whether you need to produce a functional prototype, or a run of production parts, the possibilities are virtually endless. 

Our technology partners include the Department of Defense, U.S. Air Force, Boeing, DARPA, Penn State University's Applied Research Laboratory and Lockheed Martin.

Call the metal 3D printing experts at Sciaky today and find out how EBAM™ – Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing – can save you significant time and money on the production of your critical metal parts.

Manufacture of Steel by Bessemer Process

Molten pig iron from the blast furnace is stored in a mixer to keep the pig iron molten and at an identical temperature and also keep the composition of the molten metal from dissimilar lots quite uniform.

     Bessemer is tilted on its side to receive molten iron from the mixer. Then Bessemer is brought back to vertical location and air is blown in at a pressure of 20 lbs. per square inch. The air will combine with molten metal. Dark red flames mixed with brown flames will come out of the mouth of the convertor in the beginning showing the burning of silicon and manganese. With these flames particles of molten iron and molten slag also come out.

04uKmaKa8DU,Manufacturing Predictions - The future of the manufacturing industry (ISCF - Clean Growth),"What will the future of manufacturing be like?

Imagine needing a new part for a household appliance. You could order it, get it made locally and get it delivered to your door within a couple of hours.

Advances in 3D Printing and additive manufacturing will reduce waste even more, making it possible to create products and components that we can't make now.

Everything will be connected by the Internet of Things to ensure that supply can keep track of changes in demand.

Robots will take care of the repetitive, dangerous processes so that people can focus on matters where human interaction is so valuable. 

So whether you are a manufacturer or a consumer, we are going to see much more manufacturing as part of our everyday lives.

Anything, anywhere

In the next 30 years, we will see manufacturing become more and more unbound from the idea of factories as we know them today. It will be freed up to appear in new locations, becoming an empowering force that drives customisation and personalisation of products across multiple sectors. All of this thanks to 3D printing innovation.

Fast forward to 2035: Do you see a piece of jewellery you like in a shop window, but it’s not quite the right colour or size? The shop will be able to 3D print you a custom piece in minutes, based precisely on your measurements and preferences. 3D Printing will drive a true paradigm shift for manufacturing, away from the mass production in a distant factory to something that happens right in front of you, creating a bespoke product for the same cost. By 2050 you may even be able to print clothes at home from designs shared online.
