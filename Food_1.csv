Today, I’m (Trevor James, The Food Ranger) bringing you with us as we venture into the DEEP street foods of Old Dhaka to taste some of the best restaurants in Dhaka. Bangladeshi Street Food HEAVEN!!! Make sure to watch all the way until the end of this street food video because there is a lot of delicious cuisine you are going to love!! I’m a food lover and food vlogger who has been traveling full time around the world to bring you the best street food around the world! In today’s food and travel video, we’re in Old Dhaka trying some AMAZING Bangladeshi street food that is MIND BLOWING and tasty!!!

When we first flew in to Dhaka, Bangladesh, we had no idea how AMAZING Bengali cuisine is. After trying the street food in Old Dhaka, I’m convinced that it’s some of the best street food around the world, and that Street food in Bangladesh is worth spending a lifetime exploring! 

First up, we’re going to the Dhaka University area to try a famous street food in Dhaka, the Kola Bhorta, an ULTRA complex and delicious street food made in a mortar and pestle. It had hog plum, mustard, olive, tamarind, sugar, chili, coriander, and chili, and was made by the most friendly vendor! It was spicy, sour, bitter, sweet, pungent, and very intense!

Next, we’re bringing you to the New Market area of Dhaka, right outside Old Dhaka, an area bustling with food stalls and super fast paced bustle. The street food vendors here work with ULTRA FAST speed and you can tell that everyone is in a hurry because there is so much food and street stalls packed in here. I ordered a Bhel Puri, a kind of crispy puff filled with chickpea and lentil mash and chili with tamarind chutney and topped with a cold cucumber, tomato, and onion salad. It was an amazing street food to try! 

Next up, we’re bringing you to a FAMOUS Restaurant in Dhaka, the MAMA Haleem! Here, an ULTRA THICK beef stew is prepared with lentils, wheat, mustard, and Bengali spices in a HUGE POT! It tastes so delicious and spicy and is one of the most filling street foods you’ll ever eat in the whole world! 

After that amazing street food in Bangladesh, we’re bringing you to eat a famous breakfast in Bangladesh at star hotel. Here, one of the most delicious mutton food stews AKA pays is served bright an early every day at 6am. We got up early and were surprised to see the place was PACKED with locals slurping away at this delicious Bengali food! We also ordered a beef heart curry, dal, local tea, and naan. It was an incredibly filling and flavour packed breakfast!

And before visiting the BRAIN FRY KING of Bangladesh, we’re going for a FAMOUS biryani dish in Old Dhaka, the Kachi biryani. It was prepared in these huge pots with big goat leg pieces and was one of the most aromatic biryani’s I’ve ever tried! It had a caraway flavour and was a little mustardy as well! Mustard is such an important part of Bengali cuisine, and we fell in love with the food during our trip mainly because of this mustard flavour in everything, it’s so delicious and fluffy!!

After the AMAZING Biryani, we’re bringing you to our final stop, the BRAIN FRY KING of Bangladesh! Here, you can taste amazing Brain fry and beef chap marinated in a ton of spices and put into a deep and dark oil that is intensely flavourful. When it comes out, you grab a luchi and wrap it up and pop it in your mouth, and it’s quite delicious! Watching the BRAIN FRY KING of Bangladesh work with superhuman speed as he fries up the brain and the beef chap was very fun!

This video is all about amazing Indian Street Food in the city of Kolkata.

EoYFFbVKX5E,Disneyland FOOD REVIEW! Best &amp; Worst Foods,"I visited the happiest place on earth Disneyland! Disneyland is known for its attractions and rides, but I didn't go there for that. I went to go on a food adventure to see what best and worst foods they served in Disneyland. After touring the food stalls at the park, I had to get some real dinner because eating the food at the park didn't fill me up as much. So I went to eat some Chinese food at one of my favorite restaurants in San Gabriel.

COLOMBO, SRI LANKA - Sri Lankan food is known for crabs, and you’ll find some of the best mud crabs you’ll ever try in Sri Lanka. One of the top places to eat Sri Lankan crab curry is The Station, a seafood restaurant and bar along the ocean in Colombo. During out best of Sri Lankan food tour (https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry.tourist/), this was the first meal we had, and it was outstanding.

I met up with Uchith (https://www.instagram.com/uchith/), Nick (https://www.instagram.com/nimz_gd/), and Lakki (https://www.instagram.com/lakkiw/), who showed me the restaurant and took me to the kitchen to watch as they made their entire family recipe for Sri Lankan crab curry, using huge 1.5 kg. Sri Lankan mud crabs. It was fascinating and a learning experiences to watch all the different steps and the complicated ingredients used in their recipe.

As I kept watching the Sri Lankan crab curry being made, I could hardly contain my excitement or mouth juices!

Our entire group came, and they started bringing out more dishes - not just the Sri Lankan crab curry, but river prawns fried in black pepper, and spiny lobster hollowed out and re-added to its shell. It was stunningly good. Along with Sri Lankan food, The Station also has a few of their own unique, Sri Lankan fusion seafood dishes, including favorites like hot butter squid.

Sri Lankan crab curry - we had one pan of their original Sri Lankan family recipe crab curry, and one pan of their extra spicy crab curry. Both were outstanding, but I loved the original for the spice blend and balance and how all the juices soaked up into the crab, it was outstanding. 

The Sri Lankan food and crab curry was outstanding, the people, our entire group, and the owners of The Station are incredible people as well. Thank you to The Station, Nick, Uchitch and Lakki.

Address: 1/41, Wasala Ln, Colombo, Sri Lanka

» THE TRADITIONAL FOOD IN MADAGASCAR

1. TSENA’NY TANTSAHA TALATAMATY: Rice Porridge + Chinese Noodle Soup
ADDRESS: Talatamaty City  
OPEN: 3AM - 7AM (or whenever the police shut it down) 

Four miles outside of Madagascar’s capital city, Antananarivo, lies Talatamaty City. Talatamaty City is home to one of the country’s largest local morning markets, Tsena’ny Tantsaha. Sellers open up shop at 3am, selling everything from produce to fabrics. And lucky for us, the market has no shortage of food to try as well. 

🥣RICE PORRIDGE: Zebu (Malagasy cattle) and sausage are mixed with leaves, ginger, special Malagasy rice, porridge and spices. 

🥡CHINESE NOODLE DISH: Pasta, macaroni, potato, mayonnaise and zebu skin. 
----
2. TALATA VOLON’ONDRY: Sausage + Koba
ADDRESS: Talata Volon’ondry 
OPEN: Varies 

Talata Volon’ondry is a village located just outside of Antananarivo. The village is known for producing sausage and Madagascar’s national snack, koba. 

🥔SAUSAGE: There are typically two types of sausage being sold - zebu sausage and a halal style potato sausage. This snack is frequently accompanied by local rum. 

🇲🇬KOBA: Lay out banana leaf spines with banana leaves on top. Add a layer of rice flour to prevent the koba mixture from sticking to the banana leaves. Then add the koba mixture, a combination of crushed raw peanuts and sugar. Wrap it all up in the banana leaves and allow it to cook in a bit of water for 3 days. 

Koba is beloved across Madagascar, primarily sold on the street or to people in their cars as they drive through a city. The fuel from the ingredients gives people energy and helps them stay full even when walking long distances without and source of food along the way.
💸PRICE: Sausage .14 USD/500 MGA | Koba .50 USD/1,756 MGA

Bangladesh is a true street food heaven. We didn't know when we flew in, but there is a LOT of delicious street food to eat in Bangladesh. In Old Dhaka, AKA Puran Dhaka, you can  spend a lifetime trying new street foods around every corner. And what I loved so much from eating street food around Old Dhaka was not only the delicious mustardy flavour of the street food here, but the friendliness of the Bangladeshi people. 

Everywhere we went to eat street food in Bangladesh, the peoople welcomed us with open hearts and a big smile. It left a huge impression on us and left us inspired to come back to eat more street food in Bangladesh again. 

The Bengali food you will taste when you travel in Bangladesh is incredibly delicious. After tasting my first bharta in Old Dhaka, I was convinced that this is some of the best street food around the world. There truly is no other flavour like the food in Bangladesh! You have to come here to try it yourself!

To start out our HUGE Bangladesh Street Food Tour, we visited Puran dhaka AKA Old dhaka bright and early to eat some famous Dhakan Bhakor Khani, also known as the Dhakan biscuit. It's a wheat dough and semolina flour biscuit that has 2 versions, one sweet and one plain. The sweet version has dough and semolina soaked in molasses and saffron. The dough is pushed DEEP inside the tandoor oven, the same ovens used to cook famous Bangladeshi recipes all over the country. It goes PERFECTLY with some delicious Bangladeshi street chai! There are many Bakorkhani stalls in Puran Daka (Old Dhaka), but we visited the most famous one, Nashu Faruker Shera Bakorkhani.

After that amazing Bangladeshi street food biscuit, we went for the ULTIMATE meal of Bangladeshi cuisine, the bhorta feast! We're taking you to Nirob Hotel for some AMAZING Bhortas! When you first come to Bangladesh, everyone tells you to eat the Bhortas, and you may not be sure what they are. Bhortas are a special Bengali cuisine usually made of mashed fish or mashed vegetables with mustard oil, chili, garlic, onion, and the occasional sprinkle of lime. The bhortas are all brought to your table and you pay for what you eat, and leave what you don't touch. I ate a SPICY duck curry that was out of this world! 

After the amazing Bengali curry heaven, we made our way to the most FAMOUS street food in Old Dhaka, the haji biryani. Highly seasoned rice is cooked in mustard oil and filled with extremely tender goat meat and topped with lime! SUPER TASTY!

After this, we're bringing you to a solid street dessert in Old Dhaka, Bangladesh, the lassi and faluda, found at beauty lassi, one of the tastiest lassis in the whole country! I personally loved the faluda and found it to be one of my favourite desserts I've ever had!

After the lassi, we're taking you to try a famous Bangladeshi street food, the Pitha rice flour pancake loaded with spicy mustard bhorta. You can find these all over the streets of Old Dhaka and you should definitely try one!

After this, we're finishing off the night by going for the famous Murgh pulao found at nanna biryani. The best part of this dish was the sweet and rich onion gravy that covered the super tender chicken and pulao rice!

If you're thinking of traveling to Bangladesh to eat street food in Bangladesh, DO IT! The food is amazing, the people are friendly, and you will have a great time! I know we will be back for sure!

LxnVCdzM9B8,Huge DEEP FRIED River Shrimp - Thai Food at Legendary Kui Mong (กุ่ยหมง) Restaurant!,"Watch more from Bangkok food tour: https://youtu.be/V3JiWEX81hU
Best of Bangkok food tour with The Hungry Tourist: https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry.tourist/

During the Best of Bangkok Food Tour with The Hungry Tourist (https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry.tourist/) and Puppup (https://www.instagram.com/puppup_foodlife/), one day for lunch we drove out to Kui Mong (กุ่ยหมง), a legendary restaurant that is the original restaurant in Thailand serving deep fried river shrimp (prawns).

In order to get the largest size, Puppup had to actually call the restaurant to order them one month in advance. If you just walk in you can get 400 or 600 gram shrimp probably, but the 800 gram single shrimp are hard to come by these days in Thailand.

Kui Mong (กุ่ยหมง) is very well known among Thais, mainly because most restaurant grill their river shrimp, but Kui Mong (กุ่ยหมง) is the first to deep fry them, and serve them in a ridiculously delicious oily shrimp sauce. The sauce is one of the greatest things you’ll ever taste on rice, combined with more chili garlic sauce and an alternating bite of succulent river shrimp.

They owners family are very nice, but unfortunately since it’s such a secret recipe, we weren’t able to see the cooking - so that’s why this is just a short extra Thai food video - only showing the massive deep fried Thai river shrimp and eating them.

Price - 2,000 THB ($63.44), per 800 grams shrimp

Eyzh-YOqNBU,Top 18 Fat Burning Foods For Women,"The top 18 foods that women should eat to lose weight fast and burn fat fast. It isn’t easy to lose weight fast. People always say that a lifestyle change needs to be made in order to lose the weight and keep it off. We are also told that to lose weight we need to eat healthier and work out regularly. Well, it’s true, and in this video, we’ll count down the top foods women should eat when they are trying to lose weight!

#WeightLoss #BurnFat #LoseWeight

Music:
https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music

Summary:
18. Citrus Fruits: According to a study done in 2016 by the American Chemical Society, citrus fruits can prevent obesity-related heart disease, diabetes, and liver disease. One way to get more citrus in your diet is by adding them to your water.

17. Walnuts: We have known for a while that eating nuts is good for you, but now we know which ones are the best to eat. A study in the journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism found that walnuts, in particular, contain an ingredient that can satisfy your appetite, making you feel fuller for longer. This will cause you eat less!

16. Popcorn: The University of Scranton performed a study that found that popcorn contains large amounts of polyphenols. Polyphenols are linked to many health benefits such as improved digestion and better blood circulation. If you don’t add any salt, butter or oil, and if you air pop your popcorn, this can be a great healthy snack to help you lose weight.

15. Berries: Scientists at Harvard University found in 2016 that increasing the daily intake of berries, such as blueberries and strawberries, can help people lose weight for the long term. It is said that the reason for this is because berries have high amounts of flavonoids which have been linked to weight loss.

14. Whole Grains: A Tufts University study proved that people who eat three or more daily servings of whole grains such as oatmeal had 10 percent less belly fat than people who ate the same amount of white carbs. This is said to be because whole grains are higher in fiber, which keeps you full for longer.

13. Avocados: A study published in the journal Internal Medicine Review found that avocados can help people lose weight for many reasons. The reason for this weight loss is because avocados are rich in many nutrients that help with higher intakes of fiber, healthy fats, vitamins E and C, folate, magnesium, copper and potassium. 

12. Cayenne Pepper: The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition performed a study that found that daily consumption of one of the compounds found in pepper speeds up abdominal fat loss. It does this by boosting the body’s ability to convert food into energy. Next time you’re cooking, add some cayenne pepper to spice up some meat or vegetarian dishes.

11. Salmon: A 2015 study from Kyoto University found that salmon helps your body transform fatty white fat cells into fat-burning beige cells. Salmon helps build muscle when following a steady workout routine. It also contains the right types of fats, such as Omega-3s, which helps your body burn more fat.

10. Cinnamon: Researchers at the University of Michigan have found that cinnamaldehyde, which is an essential oil in cinnamon, activates thermogenesis. Thermogenesis is a metabolic bodily process that helps burn calories and produce heat. So if you add some cinnamon to your oatmeal in the morning, you’re literally going to be burning fat cells.

9. Apples and Pears: Research which was posted on the US National Library of Medicine in 2003 stated the results of a study by the State University of Rio de Janeiro on a correlation between apples, pears, and weight loss. Women were instructed to eat apples, pears, or oatmeal cookies three times a day. After 12 weeks the group that had a fruit supplement lost more weight and had a greater decrease in blood glucose than the group that ate the oatmeal cookies.

8. Chicken: A 2013 study in the medical journal Obesity found that boosting dietary protein decreases total body fat and abdominal fat and helps increase lean body mass and your body’s energy expenditure during periods of weight maintenance and weight loss.

3uOKebaeSi0,Allahabad Food Tour - Makhan ke ANDE - SAKODA (Spicy Pakoda) - Gulab Jamun (Allahabadi RASGULLA) 2/2,"The sheer amount of food to try in Allahabad is insane. Trust us, if you start exploring the streets for food you will not be disappointed. 

First Stop- Indian Coffee House
We started our day with the basics- coffee and keema omelette. Wait! Ok not so basic. The keema omelette serves as the perfect start to your day. It is not too spicy and not heavy either, but it will keep you stomach happy and satisfied.

Second Stop- Sheebu Omelette Shop
If you’re looking for that perfect breakfast and chai combination, this is the place to be. This 35 year old shop is known for serving some of the most buttery Bun- Omelette in the area. The omelette is very simple, it consists of onions, green chillies and coriander and cooked in a whole lot of butter. You can either go for the bun-omelette or a simple bun-butter, and boy do they use butter liberally! Enjoy all of this with a side of steaming hot chai.

Third Stop- VIP Rasgulla
For all those people who are going to get confused when they see Gulab Jamuns instead of Rasgullas, hold your horses people! In Allahabad, the humble gulab jamuns are known as rasgulla. VIP Rasgulla is known for some of the tastiest gulab jamun. These gulab jamuns have dried fruits and cardamom in the filling as well. Truly delicious!

Fourth Stop- Dehati Rasgulla Shop
Another famous rasgulla/gulab jamun shop. These gulab jamuns are slightly darker in colour since the khoya is cooked for a longer time is caramelized. These gulab jamuns are fried twice to get the deep dark colour that gives it a unique taste.

Fifth Stop- Sophiya Lawrence Betel Shop
The paan here is unlike any we have had. The stickiness that the normal meetha paan has because of the gulkand cannot be tasted in this paan. It is as smooth as butter. 

Sixth Stop- Pandit Ji ki Chaat
When it comes to chaat we really let loose. We tried a number of different dishes here. The gol gappas served here are not your run of the mill ones. They serve you gol gappa/pulki with a variety of fillings- with chickpeas and tamarind chutney, super hot and spicy sakoda curry or with dahi and tamarind chutney. They also give the Allahabadi classic Sakoda in a kulhad. Sakoda is a fritter made with pulses and spinach and served in a curry that is super hot. The Hara Aloo or basically aloo chaat is quite unique, with flavors of coriander and green chillies. Then to cool oneself down, go for the dahi badas.

Seventh Stop- Nirala Mishtan Bhandar
Here we tried the aloo ki tikiya that is nicely fried in desi ghee. It is topped with tamarind chutney, yoghurt, aloo lachha. This dish is super crispy and super tasty. Here also get the Kaali Gajar ke Halwa and some of the best laddus we have tried in a long time.

Eighth Stop- Hari Ram & Sons
This shop has been since 1890 serving dried samosas to worldwide and a lot more. The samosa is stuffed with potatoes and fried in desi ghee. These samosas are supposed to have a shelf life of a month.

Ninth Stop- Raja Ram Lassi
Right across Hari Ram & Sons is this lassi shop. Their lassi comes in the good old kulhad. It is thick and creamy and is flavoured with some saffron, and topped off with a layer of cream and rabri.

Tenth Stop- Shri Radhey Ras Kunj Sweet House
Another unique discovery was Makhan ke Andey at this place. The butter is shaped like an egg and has a filling of khoya mixed with saffron which ends up looking like a yolk.

Eleventh Stop- Ahmad Kabab Centre
This place is a Kabab lover’s delight! We tried the roasted chicken, haryali chicken, roasted chicken wings, and nizami chicken tikka. Everything is beautifully marinated here that the spices have literally seeped into every part of the chicken pieces.

Twelfth Stop- Bukhara Mughlai Khana
Our final stop was all about home cooked food. This place is known for meals that are cooked at home and sold to people to spread the joy. Here we had some shammi kababs, boti kabab and mutton in khara masala along with some ulte tawe ka paratha and roomali roti. Each and every dish was not too spicy  or oily and it tastes just like home.

KARACHI, Sindh, Pakistan

From the mountains on Hunza Valley, we flew to Karachi, on the Arabian sea, and a world of difference from the mountains. I was happy to be in Karachi to discover the amazing street food, and it didn’t let us down!

Here are the things we ate on this ultimate Pakistani street food tour of Karachi, Pakistan:

Javed Nihari - I’ve probably said this a few times, but there’s no meatier breakfast (maybe in the world) than nihari, a meat stew that’s often paired with plenty of desi ghee and either brains of bone-marrow. It’s truly a breakfast of meat loving champions, but it is filling and heavy, and so good. Javed Nihari is one of the best places in Karachi to eat nihari.
Total price - 1,150 PKR ($8.42)

Burns Road - We continued on to Burns Road, one of the legendary street food streets in Karachi. It was a Sunday morning and there were elections happening, so Burns road wasn’t actually that busy. But we did find a few delicious things to try.

Arabian paratha - The Arabian paratha, or mataba, or any other names it has across Asia is a stuffed roti. In this case he filled it with chicken and spices and egg before wrapping it up and shallow frying it. It was delicious.
Price - 120 PKR ($0.88)

Matka kulfi - Also on Burns Road is a maka kulfi shop where they sell Pakistani ice cream in little clay cups. The pistachio and saffron were the best.
Price - 50 PKR ($0.37) each

Rabri - I’m not huge on sweets, but on Burns Road we need to try rabri.
Price - 200 PKR ($0.88)

Chicken biryani - Just randomly walking around we decided to try our first plate of Karachi biryani - and Karachi is known for their biryani. It was simple, but very good, with a wonderful flavor of dried lime, and it was just a very cool spot.
Price - 80 PRK ($0.59)

Liaquatabad - We continued this Pakistani street food tour of Karachi in Liaquatabad a busy market area, full of street food.

Qadri Nalli Biryani - This was the highlight of the food tour, if not one of the best dishes of my entire trip to Pakistan. Nalli biryani, Pakistani bone marrow biryani is one of the best things ever.
Price - They wouldn’t charge us

Salad - His ninja chopping skills brought me in and there was no way I couldn’t stop to eat his salad. Amazing!
Price - 40 PKR ($0.28)

MashAllah Fish Katakat - The next meal we had was MashAllah Fish Katakat, and a dish called katakat. Most of the time its prepared with organs, but this was with fish, and it was again one of the best dishes I ate in Pakistan. An amazing combination of fish, spices, and chutney.

Landhi Dairy Colony - Next we headed to the biggest buffalo colony in Asia, maybe the world. Over 700,000 - 800,000 cattle and livestock live within this area that is within Karachi, Pakistan. It was fascinating to visit and drink the freshest buffalo milk possible.

Dua Restaurant - Finally for dinner we finished this Karachi street food tour at Dua Restaurant, a huge restaurant serving grilled meat and karahis. The prawns karahi was the highlight for me.
Total price - 4,840 PKR ($35.45)

It was an amazing day of street food in Karachi, Pakistan!

Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF! Spicy Chinese Dan Dan noodles are the best street food in China! If you love spicy Sichuan food and street food in China, then you're going to love Dan Dan noodles, because they are so flavorful and covered in a rich chili oil!

In this Chinese street food video, we're bringing you on a full on Dan Dan noodle tour of Chengdu, China, DEEP in the heart of Sichuan in Southwest China. This is the land of delicious and spicy Sichuan cuisine, sometimes spelled Szechuan cuisine. There are so many famous Sichuan foods to try here in Chengdu, but today, we are trying 4 different variations of Dan Dan noodles, also sometimes called Zajiang noodles.

China has so many amazing street foods to try, and I've been filming and documenting them for you for the past 4 years. In my opinion, the best noodle dish in China is dan dan noodles, right here in Chengdu, Sichuan. China has some of the best street food around the world, and these dan dan noodles were INSANELY GOOD, some of the best noodles in China for sure!

If you're traveling to China to eat and try different street foods, and perhaps want to learn a little bit about Chinese food and chinese cooking in the process, you need to try a few different variations of Dan Dan noodles. When they prepare the traditional Chinese dan dan noodle recipe right on the street, you can watch as they scoop the main ingredients like chili oil, soy sauce, sichuan peppercorn, and garlic right into the noodle bowl and then place the steaming hot noodles right over top. It's truly satisfying! After they put the noodles over top, they place their signature fried ground pork on top, known in Chinese as shaozi. 

When your dan dan noodles arrive to your table, it is very important to mix up all the chili oil and all of the ingredients throughout. This ensures that the flavour and the hot oil gets coated onto each noodle before you take a bite. It's also quite satisfying mixing the noodles and watching the dark red oil slowly turn each noodle from white into red and silky smooth. 

When you take your first bite, you'll understand why this is one of the BEST Chinese street foods you need to try. The spicy noodles are coated with an incredibly aromatic chili oil and really send you straight up to heaven! It's one of the best forms of Chinese cooking!

Thanks to Ali and Shehroze for hosting me.

Lyari Town is one of the eighteen constituent towns of Karachi, known as Little or Mini Balochistan. Just a few years ago, Lyari was ruled by gangs, and known for its brutal violence and unrest. But recently things have changed for the better.

We wanted to visit Lyari, Karachi, for one because I didn’t have a chance to visit Balochistan on my trip to Pakistani, and for two - in our very short visit, to share a story of people, hope, and those who are making a difference.

After walking around one of the colorful neighborhoods, we jumped in a rickshaw to go find breakfast. Not totally sure where we ended up, but we found a man who was extremely friendly and hospitable and a popular place to eat breakfast.

His food scooping skills were impressive!

The food was delicious, and the entire experience was memorable and rewarding.

Sometimes you may have heard me pronouncing o and some times a in the word Rasgulla… In Bengal it is pronounced wtih O letter in between….

Very tasty, if you travel to Kolkata then you must have Rassogolla on day 1...

Korean Seafood - https://youtu.be/pObPqffympM

Our final video in Seoul, South Korea features the classics of KOREAN STREET FOOD, starting at the Gwangjang Market (Kwangjang Market). We sample some of our favourite Korean dishes including tteokbokki, kimchi mandu and japchae. We also stopped on the way out for dessert, eating a bean porridge which was delicious! We explore the famous Ikseon-dong Hanok village for souvenirs and stop at a busy coffee shop for sweets and caffeine. Later that day, we eat something that you CAN’T MISS while in Korea - KOREAN BBQ! This Korean barbecue cooks the pork belly and the kimchi together - and the mix is delicious. We washed the meal down with soju. It was an AWESOME day of eating Korean food. For information on how to visit yourself, see below:

NZNElbAP9_E,"▌The #1 Type of Food For Increasing Your Libido, Sex Drive &amp; Testosterone Levels▐","A simple, yet scientifically proven way of boosting your testosterone and increasing your sex drive naturally...
►►► http://drsam.co/yt/BoostYourTestosteroneNaturally

===============================================
The #1 Type of Food For Increasing Your Libido, Sex Drive & Testosterone Levels
===============================================
Today I’m going to simplify the topic of increasing your “sex drive & libido”. 

I’m going to clarify all the silly misunderstandings about this important subject.

I would say that 95% of the information you hear about this topic -- online, articles, blogs, youtube and so forth --- it's ALL WRONG!

These so called ‘experts’ list foods such as “special” fruits or vegetables that have lots of good vitamins.

Or spicy foods or alcohol because they may increase your blood flow.

Or beans or meat because they have healthy protein.

Or whole grains because they have fiber and help with weight loss.

It’s a lot of “stuff” that *may* help a LITTLE…

 but they NEVER address the REAL problem and CAUSE of low libido, 

which is a HORMONAL IMBALANCE!

That’s it!

If your sex drive and libido isn’t where you’d like it to be or where it used to be.

If you have a hard time getting or maintaining an erection.

If you’re just not “driven” -- mentally, physically  or emotionally -- when it comes to sex or just life in general.

Then the problem is hormonal imbalance which typically means:
LESS “pro-sexual” hormones - such as testosterone.
MORE “anti-sexual” hormones - such as estrogen, prolactin and cortisol

So let’s increase the good and decrease the bad.

EAT FAT!

The best type of food that increases testosterone is FAT and more specifically, saturated fats and cholesterol.

Now, you might be freaking out and think “okay Dr. Sam -- you’re insane!!! My cholesterol is going to go through the roof and I’m going to have a heart attack!”

Nope, not true.

First of all, over 80% of the cholesterol found in your blood and arteries is NOT from foods you eat -- but produced from your LIVER! (1)

Cholesterol and saturated fats help produce most of your sex hormones - especially testosterone.

Cholesterol helps lower your stress hormone, cortisol -- which does the OPPOSITE of testosterone.

In fact, without cholesterol you’d die eventually.

And for those of you are are really concerned about having high cholesterol -- the PRIMARY cause of high cholesterol is AGING and the change in your hormones!!!

This is why the older you get, the worse your cholesterol levels.

This is why women who go through menopause start having high cholesterol.

Again, it all comes down to a hormonal imbalance!!!

What MATTERS is WHERE you get your fats.

Don’t go fry up some bacon and think this is healthy.

Most animal and dairy fats are the problem.

Heating oils, processed vegetable fats, hydrogenated and trans fats are the problem.

Instead, have HEALTHY fats.

Have free range eggs WITH the yolk. 

The BEST way to eat eggs are RAW --- but if you can’t do that, at least keep the yolk runny and soft, which will increase your “good” HDL cholesterol.(2)

If you want to have some free range, grass fed meat or bison/buffalo 2-3x a week, that’s fine too.

Grass fed red meat has higher levels of CLA fats, which boost testosterone, reduce cortisol, are anti-inflammatory and help reduce many forms of cancer (4)

Other than that, I would stay away from most other meats because they’re processed and full of negative hormones such as ESTROGEN, which will LOWER your testosterone and libido.

Lastly, have some HEALTHY saturated fats and one of the best is raw, extra virgin coconut oil.

Not only does raw coconut oil improve your testosterone and fat-burning hormones, it also helps increase blood flow and circulation -- both of which are important for your sex drive and erections.(3)

Follow me on Insta: http://bit.ly/2c5ojch
And subscribe to my channel here: http://bit.ly/2cCy2ub
Chinese food. Chinese street food. I love you. The cuisine I sampled in the last year living in China was unreal. I've combined my top 5 Chinese food picks into one video. I mostly eat Sichuan food, so there may be some bias, but believe me, the food I ate this year, whether Chinese street food or Chinese market food or eating at nice Chinese restaurants, I've narrowed down into 5 delicious picks for you!

The addresses will be updated on this video soon:

Number 5:
""On the paper fish"" - 纸上烤鱼 ""Zhi shang kaoyu""
This is a grilled fish ""on the paper"", so that there is no charring of any ingredients and all the flavours of the spicy and garlicky broth are soaked into the fish. You also order additional ingredients, like eggs, lotus root, tofu, potato, cilantro, and greens. I ate this one in Chengdu. It's a great Chengdu food to try.

Number 4 - Leshan duck - 甜皮鸭 ""Tian pi ya""
This is the famous Leshan ""sweet skinned duck"". It's stewed in ginger, onions, sugar, salt, star anise, Sichuan peppercorn, cinnamon, fennel, cloves, and cardamom. It's super easy and this is one of my favourite ducks in all of China.

Number 3 - Firewood Chicken - 柴火鸡 ""Chaihuoji""
This was truly a magical experience. A whole chicken is chopped up and put into a wok heated by wood fire. It's boiled in a wok full of Sichuan broad bean paste and dried chilies, making it super spicy, juicy, and salty.  The wok is full of other vegetable ingredients that you personally order. I ordered potatoes to keep it classic. The best part of the whole meal is when they take a dough and place it on the side of the wok and put the lid over it, making these gooey and sticky and crispy on the outside. So satisfying. Another great Sichuan food to try in Chengdu.

Number 2 -Xinjiang food
Xinjiang food is a huge culinary world that I can't say I've fully sampled. But what I did try in Urumqi was amazing. I had a meal at a traditional Xinjiang restaurant that was 3 main Xinjiang foods: Pumpkin and Lamb steamed buns, Xinjiang Lamb Kebabs, and A lamb and onion and black pepper ""rounang"" stuffed bread.

Number 1 - Tibetan food- ""Xizang cai""
I tried this food at the four girls mountain range in Western Sichuan. This meal was so so satisfying and really rich and heavy. It consisted of spicy yak meat, fresh local potatoes, fresh local first growth forest hand picked greens fried up in a wok with yak butter, fresh tibetan ""butter tea"", and blood sausage. Yet the best part of this meal was eating with the local people of the area. They were so welcoming and friendly and it really felt like a once in a lifetime experience to just sit down and chat with them in their little living room heated by a wood stove in the coldest part of the winter. What a try experience!

Was there something that you think I should have put in this list? What would you like to try most? What are your thoughts about this video? Leave me a comment below about anything, I love hearing from you!

Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF! We visited Dubai in the UAE to try some traditional Emirati Cuisine, and joined up with our friend Peyman to eat a whole camel platter with rice and eggs!

►Check out Peyman's Channel Here: http://bit.ly/PeymanSubscribe

This is a traditional Emirati meal that is usually reserved for special occasions or very exclusive guests. It's not a normal Dubai Street Food, but that's why it's so good. It is an extremely rare Arab food nowadays! You have to be incredibly lucky to experience this whole camel platter! This is definitely one of the must try foods in Dubai! It is a traditional Emirati food and is one of the best things to do in Dubai. Camel meat is something that may be sensitive to some viewers, so make sure you're comfortable with watching the camel cooking! The chefs who prepared the camel recipe were originally from the South of India in Kerala, but have been living in Dubai for over 20 years.

If you're thinking of traveling to Dubai for a food trip, you can't go wrong, there is so much delicious Emirati cuisine and amazing street food to try! I must admit, most of the food is in Dubai restaurants that are clean and quiet, but that is part of the charm of Dubai.

First, Peyman and I checked out the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, and then made our way to the one and only Camel Restaurant, address below:

Entire Camel Platter in Dubai: Zaman Awal Restaurant
Address: Al Boom Village, Dubai, UAE, United Arab Emirates

If you're wondering if you should eat street food in Dubai or go for regular restaurants in Dubai, I recommend mixing it up and going for both. In this food video, we are solely visiting one of the best restaurants in dubai for the whole camel plate.

She is super morbidly obese and addicted to food. Sacha lives with her nine-year old son, Lewis, who is also overweight. Her weight is ruining her life - she is so ashamed of her size, she refuses to get out of the car when she picks up Lewis from school - fearing he will get bullied as a result. Her decision to undergo surgery was prompted by the realisation that she would only survive a maximum of five years without any surgery. She is petrified of dying on the operating table and leaving her son alone.

Huge thank you to Fadhlur for reaching out and taking us on a Malaysian street food tour of Kuala Lumpur. It was an amazing day, and I have so much love to Malaysia as it was one of the first countries where I started making street food videos - as you’ll see in the video!

Ok, here are all the street food stalls and restaurants we ate at on this tour:

Mansion Tea Stall
The thing to order here is the roti canai special, roti that chopped up, then doused in a variety of curry sauces, sambal, and a few soft boiled eggs. It’s a perfect way to begin your day in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 2.80 RM ($0.68) per plate

Nasi Lemak Tanglin
Nasi lemak is often considered the national food of Malaysia, and there are plenty of places to eat it throughout Kuala Lumpur. Having been around since 1948, Nasi Lemak Tanglin is a place I had wanted to go for a while. It was overall very good, with a nice laid back atmosphere and surrounded by nature. Nasi lemak - about 8 RM ($1.94) per plate

Ikan Bakar Seri Melaka (Jalan Bellamy)
One of my favorite places to eat ikan bakar, grilled fish, is on Jalan Bellamy. Back in 2012, I had to hike over a highway and climb a few fences to get there as I was only on foot. In this video, I’m a bit older, and we had a car! The ikan bakar was just as good as I remember it. Total price - 68 RM ($16.51) for everything

Sri Ganapathi Mess
One of the best things about Malaysian food is its incredible diversity, including Malay, Chinese, and Indian food. Banana leaf south Indian food is very popular and I was recommended to try Sri Ganapathi Mess, a restaurant tucked away into a home. An amazing south Indian food experience in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 59 RM ($14.32) for 4 people

Kedai Kopi Lai Foong
Finally, another dish that many had recommended me was the unique clam noodles in Kuala Lumpur Chinatown at the legendary Kedai Kopi Lai Foong. It was delicious, and a perfect way to end an amazing Malaysian street food tour in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 10 RM ($2.43) per bowl

 We found a bunch of unique and delicious Vietnamese street foods that you really need to try, all around Hanoi's old quarter! Despite this area being quite tourist, we found a lot of delicious food, so far, this has been the BEST street food city I've visited in Southeast asia!

In this Vietnam Street Food tour video, Myself (Trevor James, The Food Ranger), am taking you on a food street journey to many delicious, mouthwatering street food places around Hanoi in Northern Vietnam. If you're deciding whether or not to travel to Vietnam for the street food, you really need to come visit Hanoi. You can enjoy unique Vietnamese street foods hidden in Hanoi's old quarter alleyways and try classic Vietnam cuisine specialties like Pho for Breakfast, Bun Cha for lunch, A ton of different rice noodle dishes, and a ton of other hidden delights.

 Over the past 3 years,  I've filmed and eaten street food around China, including locations like Chengdu, Lanzhou, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Beijing, Wuhan, Leshan, Shanghai, and Xinjiang's Silk Road. So far, the street food in each of these locations has been the best street food around the world! BUT, I haven't shot a ton of street food in Southeast Asia, so we made it our goal to come to Vietnam to try the street foods. So far, it has totally been worth it!
 
Vietnamese cuisine is so delicious, and even though I've only been here a short while, I'm sure that it would really need a lifetime to eat all of it. I've decided to stay living in China, and move around to other countries like Vietnam for another year or two or even more, shooting delicious street food in china for you and across asia as well!

Here are the addresses and locations and restaurant names for the Vietnam street food I had in this Hanoi, Vietnam travel video. Most locations were deep in Hanoi's old quarter alleyways!

1) Famous Vietnamese Breakfast Pho @
Pho thin 13 lo duc
2) Delicious Bun Cha AKA Vermicelli Noodles with BBQ pork:
Bún Chả Hàng Quạt, 74 Hang Quat, Hanoi, Vietnam 
3) Very delicious Bahn Xeo (rice flour crepes/pancakes)
22 Hang Bo Street, Hoan Kiem District, Hanoi, Vietnam
4) Bun Ca AKA fish noodle soup with dill
5 NGÕ TRUNG YĒN HOÀN KIÉM
5) Hanoi Style Egg Coffee

6) Che Dessert (coconut milk with a ton of fruit jellies)

If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country.

Last weekend I filmed my summer morning routine while I was in my hometown of Amsterdam! I've been wanting to share my morning's with you guys, but I've been traveling so much I haven't been able to give you guys a REAL inside look into what I do when I am not on the road. For this routine I made one of my favorite breakfast recipes and also did my typical morning skin care routine.

I spent a little time surfing the internet for nice summer destinations, but I want to go somewhere new!

Situated in the broad Valley of Peshawar near the eastern end of the historic Khyber Pass, close to the border with Afghanistan, Peshawar's recorded history dates back to at least 539 BCE, making it the oldest city in Pakistan and one of the oldest cities in the world

Islamia College Peshawar is a reputable academic institution, the Victorian architecture and green premises is open for the visitors and the sketch of this building is also placed on 1000 Pakistani Rupee note which actually enhances its importance.

Khayber Pass, a mountain pass in north Pakistan. Close to the border of Afghanistan. It also has been the gateway of South Asia ( part of the ancient silk route). It connects the Afghan territories via torkham. Security is the main concern out there currently.

The clock tower is commonly known as “ghanta ghar” located at chowk yaadgar at a distance from the city’s busy centre. It was inaugurated in 1900 in honour to celebrate the diamond jubilee of British queen Victoria. 

The most important part of Peshawar’s local food is meat which is cooked in form “tikka”, “ karhai” “dumpukht” etc. The people there are fond of lamb meat. The way to order it at any eatery is select the variety and amount of meat, and they cook it in your presence.

Thanks to Frank and Jerry of Zouba Tours: http://www.zoubatours.com/ for taking me around. I paid for this tour, but they did a great job and I would recommend them.

Kunming, Yunnan, China - Kunming is the capital and largest city in Yunnan province China. So I was excited to explore the local market in Kunming and eat as much street food as possible!

Here are all the Chinese street food dishes we ate throughout the market:

Rice pudding - 5 RMB ($0.76) - This was slightly fermented, and sweet, like a rice alcohol pudding. It was pretty good, but quite sweet, so I couldn’t eat that much of it.

Dumpling - 1 RMB ($0.15) - I saw these dumplings sizzling and hissing and there was no way I could walk by without trying one. Stuffed inside were leek and egg. They were a little on the oily side, but delicious.

Whole duck - 20 RMB ($3.03) - Yunnan is famous for roast duck, and there’s a version that’s comparable even to Beijing style. Style I was excited to find a stall that at the market that specialize in Yunnanese roast duck. It was delicious and the owners were very friendly as well.

Pickled pears - 5 RMB ($0.76) - This was an interesting snack, and supposed to be very healthy and good for digestion. 

Drink - 2 RMB ($0.30) - This drink was incredible sweet, but refreshing.

Tofu Noodles - 5.5 RMB ($0.83) - Another extremely popular Chinese street food snack at the market was tofu noodles - I’ve had tofu and noodles, but not really mixed before. It was a little plain and starchy, but from all the sauces, it was taty.
Rice balls - 5 RMB ($0.76) - We also tried sesame rice balls which were delicious.

Jacuzzi braised ½ chicken - 15 RMB ($2.27) - This was one of the highlights of the market for me, mainly because the owner was so friendly and his giant jacuzzi of boiling chickens was amazing to see! The chicken was a little bony, but flavorful.

Yellow soybean porridge - 3.5 RMB ($0.53) - As we were leaving the market, we stopped for one last bowl of soybean porridge to eat with youtiau, Chinese donuts. I wasn’t expecting to like it as much as I did, but it was delicious. It was very warming and hearty.

Finally to complete this Chinese street food tour in Kunming, Jerry and I, along with his family ate Chinese Yunnanese bbq. It was tasty and a great way to end this amazing day of street food.

Special thanks to Zouba Tours (http://www.zoubatours.com/) for arranging everything in this video. I paid for this tour, but I think they did a great job, and I thoroughly enjoyed the food and the tour.

That completes Day 4 of this Chinese food tour of Yunnan. If you haven’t already, watch the full series here: https://goo.gl/QhiJUb

Thank you to B. Hamzaev - Head of Marketing and Promotion of Uzbekistan Tourism. Check out Bekruz: https://goo.gl/M14aZW

Uzbekistan Day 5: Tandoori Lamb and Full Tour of Ancient Bukhara, Uzbekistan!

From Samarkand, we drove to Bukhara, another ancient and well preserved city in Uzbekistan. What’s great about Bukhara is that it’s an entire ancient city that was important on the Silk Road that’s well preserved and still functioning.

Kolkhoznyy Rynok Bazaar - Ravshan (https://goo.gl/QaaBDA) who I’ve been traveling with in Uzbekistan is originally from Bukhara, so he was a great person to be with. We started in the morning, along with Bekruz for breakfast at the bazaar. We bought honey and kaymak then some very kind ladies at the bread market invited us to sit at their table. A perfect Uzbek breakfast to get the day started.

Great Minaret of the Kalon - Dating back to the 12th century, without a doubt, the Great Minaret of Kalon is a landmark in Bukhara. Even Genghis Khan, while in the process of destroying much of Bukhara, spared the minaret because of its vast beauty. It truly is spectacular.

Chor Bakr Restaurant - But we were very interested in a local Bukhara food speciality, tandoori lamb. So we drove out to Chor Bakr Restaurant, who prepare about 100 kg. of tandoori lamb for lunch. And luckily we arrived right as they were pulling it out of the oven!
Price per plate - 75,000 UZS ($9.08)

Magistral Plov Center - As I’ve learned and probably you have too, you can’t visit a city in Uzbekistan without having plov, the national dish and ultimate dish of Uzbekistan. For this version we had Bukhara plov, quite a bit more meaty than the Samarkand version, and loaded with sheep butt.

Bolo Hauz Mosque - Another beautiful sight in Bukhara is Bolo Hauz Mosque with its impressive wooden entrance area. And across the street from the mosque you’ll find Bolo Xauz Teahouse, a nice little tea house where we had a tea and snack and just relaxed for a minute. Lastly for our sightseeing of the day in Bukhara, we climbed to the top of The Ark Fortress, a huge fortified palace in Bukhara near the old city.

Labi Hovuz Restaurant - For dinner we ate at one of Bukhara’s most legendary restaurants, located in the old public square. The ambiance was great, and the hearty lamb and potato soup cooked in clay pots was delicious.

It was another wonderful day and learning experience in Uzbekistan.

If you haven’t already, you can watch the entire Uzbekistan food travel series here: https://youtu.be/A3xHJzNNM2A

Big thank you to Bekruz and the Ministry of Tourism Uzbekistan for arranging my trip to Uzbekistan.

J3H4qIWx9Tc,34 DELICIOUS FOOD HACKS WITH CHEESE AND OTHER GOODIES,"Simple recipes with cheese for everyone

There is no denying that cheese is delicious, especially when it comes to cooking with cheese. There are limitless recipes you can try with all different varieties of cheese, such as mozzarella, parmesan cheese or cheddar cheese. Since it is such a delicious ingredient for cooking and filled with protein we created some simple and delicious recipes with cheese that can try right away. In addition, we included some bonus cooking hacks and tips to make your time in the kitchen more enjoyable.

1. Simplest macaroni and cheese recipe.
If you are at work or would like to have macaroni and cheese as a snack instead of making a huge pot of food. Try this little trick that will literally take you 3 minutes to make this meal. In a mug, add a scoop of pasta, then, add the adequate amount of water and microwave for 2 minutes. Stir it really well and make sure there is no more water left in the mug. Then add some milk and cheese and stir until the cheese into the mug and Bon Appetite.

2. Delicious cheese toastie recipe
If you would like to have a nice cheese toast fast but you don't own a grill, don't let that stop you. Apply some butter on a slice of bread on both sides, then, add two slices of cheddar cheese and then another slice of bread with butter spread on it. Then, place your sandwich in a kitchen foil and seal it. After that, take your clothing iron and place it on top of the toastie for a couple of minutes max, then turn it and press the other side as well with your clothing iron and, there you have it.

3. DIY cheddar sticks
This might as well be the most delicious treat in the whole world. Take a block of cheddar cheese and cut it in rectangular blocks. Place one wooden stick in each block. Then, dip it into flour, after that dip it into an egg wash, and finally in breadcrumbs. Lastly, boil some oil and fry your cheesy sticks. Enjoy with some ketchup or the sauce of your choice.

4. Oil Hack!
Instead of accidentally pouring excess oil on your food or your frying pan. Pour some oil in a clean spray bottle and start spraying. This way you'll be able to monitor how much oil you consume and also keep your meals healthier.

5.How to make your own iced coffee
Make your filter coffee, or your espresso, or your instant coffee with hot water as you would normally do with or without sugar. (Do Not add milk). Then pour it into your ice tray and place it in the freezer. When it's time for you to have a nice glass of iced coffee, instead of running to the closest coffee shop, just take 5-6 cubes of the iced coffee you prepared, place them in a glass with some milk or water and stir. Enjoy!

Xdya8eym9nM,"Street Food in Pakistan - ULTIMATE 16-HOUR PAKISTANI FOOD Tour in Lahore, Pakistan!","Thank you to Ali (Pakistan Travel Market): https://goo.gl/VY6NjH
SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos every week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe
T-shirts and caps: https://goo.gl/6WdK1l

Also, just published a full Pakistan travel guide: https://goo.gl/5MHgz4

I’m very excited to share this first full street food in Pakistan video with you! We started our trip in Lahore, a vibrant, colorful, and packed full of food city. Our first day in Lahore turned out to be a 16 hour street food marathon in Lahore, and it was an amazing day!

Get more details on my Pakistan Travel Guide: https://goo.gl/5MHgz4

Sadiq Halwa Puri (https://goo.gl/maps/Yoy9dJ6steF2) - We began the day with a very common breakfast throughout Pakistan, halwa puri, but along with chana curry (chickpea curry). We ate off the car, enjoying every bit of the freshly fried puris and curry.
Total price - 640 PKR ($4.78)

Chacha Feeka Lassi (https://goo.gl/maps/RGQBRQaNj8p) - Next we drove over to Gawalmandi, one of the most legendary areas in Lahore for food. We headed straight to a breakfast staple, the lassi shop and had the most creamy heavy milkshake I’ve ever had, called a pera lassi.

Roasted chickpeas - 25 PKR ($0.19) - After exiting an alley, right in front of us was a man selling chickpeas and corn roasted in black Himalayan salt. It’s a very common street food snack in Pakistan.

Sweet potato - 80 PKR ($0.60) - Sweet potato is also a very common street food snack in Lahore, seasoned with masala and a type of citrus juice.

Baba Kulfi Wala - Next we headed over to Shah Alami Market, another huge and bustling market in Lahore.

Kulfi - 20 PKR ($0.15) each - One of the most famous places to eat ice cream in Lahore is Baba Kulfi Wala, and you’ll find a crowd of people standing around the corner of the road eating sticks of their famous kulfi.

Orange juice - 50 PKR ($0.37)

Chana chaat - 120 PKR ($0.89) per plate - One of my personal favorite Pakistani street food snacks of the day was chana chaat, a chickpea snack. He added in all sorts of spices, chutneys, and seasonings, to create a deliciously refreshing snack.

Butt Karahi Tikka Restaurant - Easily one of the most well known restaurants in Lahore is Butt Karahi, specializing in curry made in a rounded pan, called a karahi (we will be eating a lot of karahi’s in Pakistan!). We ordered both a mutton karahi and chicken karahi. Both were amazing, filled with spices and butter, but the tenderness of the mutton was the winner.
Total price - 5,600 PKR ($41.84)

Siddique Fish Corner - You’ll notice that Lahore seems to come alive at night, and street food is everywhere at night. We began the evening with Siddique Fish Corner, one of the best fried fish stalls in Lahore. It was awesome, and so busy.
Total price - 400 PKR ($2.99)

Khalifa Balochi Sajji - Another Pakistani dish I wanted to try was chicken sajji, a type of hand rotisserie chicken. The atmosphere and cooking method was incredible.
Total price - 390 PKR ($2.91)

Khan Baba Restaurant - Finally for our last dinner on this 16 hour day of food in Pakistan, we went to one of Ali’s favorite restaurants in Lahore, Khan Baba. The goat chops were impressive as was the korma curry.

Again, massive thank you to Ali, from Pakistan Travel Mart for hosting us in Pakistan, taking us around, and organizing everything.

OO9kSxcT9Rg,The Ultimate MEXICAN STREET FOOD TACOS Tour of Mexico City! (ft. La Ruta de la Garnacha),"►Subscribe to Lalo’s channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/vpedoardo
►T-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/

Welcome to the best tacos in the world - the ultimate guide to Mexican street food tacos in Mexico City!

I met up with Lalo from La Ruta de la Garnacha (https://www.youtube.com/user/vpedoardo), he’s from Mexico City, he makes videos about street food as well. And he took me to his favorite tacos in all of Mexico City. We each ate the most tacos in one single day that we’d ever eaten in our lives, and it was the greatest taco day of my life!

Here are all the places we ate in this video:

Tacos Joven - They are known for their tacos de canasta, which are basket tacos, famous in Mexico City. They are served from a basket, and they keep hot the entire day as they are served. The highlight here was the chicharrón taco with chicharrón salsa.
Price - 13 MXN ($0.70) per taco

Taqueria El Abanico - This is Lalo’s favorite restaurant in Mexico City for carnitas, the wildly popular braised pork taco. The entire rib in my taco was the highlight, so tender and flavorful.
Price - 20 MXN ($1.08) per taco

El Pescadito de Sonora - Originating from Hermosillo in Sonora, El Pescadito serves Mexican seafood tacos, especially shrimp or marlin tacos. Their tacototo is a taco that will change your life. This was as good as food gets for me.
Price - 35 MXN ($1.89) per taco

Tacos Charly - When it comes to Mexican street food, suadero is one of the greatest, a massive pan of slow braising beef in its juices. When you order your tacos, they slice up the meat, dip your tortilla in the fat, and you eat it with onions, cilantro, and salsa - pure meat heaven.
Price - 13 MXN ($0.70) per taco

Taqueria Los Güeros - Tacos de tripa, intestines, are very popular in Mexico City as well. They may not be the most pretty tacos, but they are immensely flavorful and have all sorts of different textures going on in your mouth.
Price - 13 MXN ($0.70) per taco

Tacos Los Juanes - This is a great Mexican street food restaurant in Mexico City that serves all sorts of different tacos. We came for the tacos de cabeza and tacos de lengua, both of which were fantastic
Price - 10 MXN ($0.54) per taco

El Vilsito - For Mexican street food in Mexico City, the ultimate taco, the most loved by everyone is no doubt, Al Pastor. Cooked in the vertical spit, a technique brought over from Lebanese immigrants, Al Pastor is usually made with marinated pork that’s juicy and flavorful it might make you weep tears of joy. Lalo and I ordered, not just your ordinary tacos de al pastor, but the King of all tacos, the Gringa!
Price - 50 MXN ($2.70) each

Thanks again to Lalo from La Ruta de la Garnacha: https://www.youtube.com/user/vpedoardo

This was the greatest taco day of my life. Thank you for watching!

When you eliminate these foods you'll find your digestive system begins to work more efficiently. This means you'll be receiving more nutrition from your food. It's the lack of nutrition which often causes weight gain as the body can go into patterns of binge eating in an attempt to receive enough nutrition. All chronic diseases are directly related to nutrient deficiencies, so it's vital to ensure your digestive system is working at its best. https://young1.life/",Food

Perfectly grilled corn-on-the-cob, the best moong dal dosas in town, Korean burritos, vegan Ethiopian, craft beers, interesting cocktails, cake, ice cream, great coffee... in other words, LOADS!  Bread Tree make bruschetta the way families in Italy have done for centuries, no short cuts. They use bread made in a small bakery in Sicily, and offer vegan and wheat-free options too! Seasonings and toppings are all sourced in Calabria, such as pickled aubergines, sundried tomatoes, pesto Calabrese, sundried tomato paste and nduja.

Also on the menu are piadina, the delicious Italian flatbread sandwich. Go for the traditional parma ham or check out one of the veggie or vegan options, all served with sauces that come from southern Italy.

Cristian’s family is originally from Calabria, where his grandfather was a producer of wine and olive oil. Rebecca, originally from Taiwan, also comes from a country where people are very passionate about great food, and she has contributed to Bread Tree her dedication to healthy ingredients.  Tea, Bread & Brownie brings a wide selection of teas, real Belgian hot chocolate and chai latte to serve at the market, as well as retail teas to take home and brew.

Also check out their range of Flour Station sourdough breads, pastries and sweet and savoury treats including cheese straws, savoury muffins, brownies, cream teas, and more, all of which have been freshly baked.

As well as buying teas to take home, you can enjoy a hot cup of tea to go. If the weather’s hot, why not try their range of ice teas and iced chai latte all summer.  The Polish Deli London offers a wide range of delicious and authentic Polish food. Sample traditionally madepork smoked sausages served with salad and pickles in a baguette, or with roasted baby potatoes, cured meats, Polish draught beer and, in winter, sauerkraut stew, made with smoked pork sausage.  When Will and Kerry hand you your gourmet burger, you’re getting it from the hands of the same people who raised the cows and grew the wheat and grass they feasted on. The beef is hung on the bone for three weeks, then they seam cut the beef (a continental style of butchery which cuts around the muscles rather than slicing straight through them). They bind the burgers with their own free range eggs. 

And if that is not enough for you, pop a couple of their steaks in your bag to take home.",Food

MELAKA, MALAYSIA - Malaysian Food Tour!

Melaka (also sometimes spelled Malacca) is a beautiful city in southern Malaysia, significant in history, packed with delicious food, and again, like most of Malaysia, a melting pot of cultures, peoples and foods.

Here’s what we ate in this food tour of Melaka, Malaysia:

Kedai Kopi Chung Wah - One of the foods you have to eat in Melaka is Hainanese chicken rice balls. The rice is cooked with chicken broth like most chicken rice, but instead of just a plate of rice, you get little fish ball shaped rice balls, along with chicken. It’s an iconic dish, but it’s pretty delicious and makes a wonderful breakfast.
Total price - 29 MYR ($7.12)

Asam Pedas Pak Man - Asam pedas is sour spicy, and you’ll find variations of it across much of Southeast Asia, but Melaka is quite famous for it within Malaysia. We went to Asam Pedas Pak Man, a stall set up within a local Malaysian food court. I ordered a variety of different plates, each asam pedas but with a different fish. All were spectacular. It looks extremely spicy, but it’s not actually all that spicy, however it is extremely tasty and full of herbs and chilies and flavor. Best Malaysian food dish of the day in Melaka for me.
Total price - 75 MYR ($18.39)

Klebang Original Coconut Shake - This was pretty ordinary for me, nothing spectacular, but again it’s one of those things most people try in Melaka.
Total price - 9.90 MYR ($2.43)

Ban Lee Siang Satay Celup - Next up, satay celup, a unique Melaka style satay where you choose your own skewers and boil them in the sauce right in the middle of your table. For me honestly, satay celup is too sweet, but I have to admit it’s a lot of fun to eat and cook, and very social.
Total price - 34 MYR ($8.34)

Ikan Bakar Haji Masu - Finally to end this Malaysian food tour in Melaka (Malacca), we went to a seafood, ikan bakar (grilled fish) restaurant. There are quite a few huge seafood restaurants in Melaka, but I wanted one that was kind of small and laid back. Ikan Bakar Haji Masu was fantastic, and I think the best thing was their grilled fish.
Total price - 99 MYR ($24.27)

Thank you for watching this Malaysian food tour in Melaka. It’s an amazing city to visit when you are in Malaysia.

Kvg9kJ35jEY,"Greek Food - STREET FOOD TOUR and Amazing Souvlaki in Athens, Greece!","Thank you to Tassos for taking me on this incredible Greek food tour of Athens!
►Subscribe - http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe
►T-shirts - https://migrationology.com/store/

Athens is a city that I’ve  wanted to visit ever since learning so much about it during one of my Western Civilizations classes in High School. Finally, I had a chance to visit, not only for the  amazing history, but mainly for the amazing Greek food!

In this video, I’m taking you on a one day, all out Greek food tour of Athens along with Tassos. We ate a combination of classic Greek street food snacks, and a few restaurants, including for dinner some of the best lamb chops I’ve ever had.

Here are all the restaurants and places included in this Greek food tour of Athens:

Dexameni Cafe - Our first stop was to drink Greek coffee in this small public square. A great environment, and the coffee was excellent.
Price - 1.80 EUR per cup

Kostarelos Deli - Tassos knows his Greek cheese and he says Kostarelos Deli has some of the best cheese in Athens.
Total price - 14.60 EUR

Mam - Mam is often considered the best Greek cheese pie in Athens, and it’s a  perfect street food kind of place. Most people take-away, but they have a standing table as well. The classic Greek cheese pie was my favorite.
Total price - 4.80 EUR

Varvakios Market - This is the Athens central market for meat and seafood. It’s a beautiful market and any lover would enjoy walking around this amazing market.

Miran - Pastourma and Soutzouki - This is a really cool little deli in Athens where you can buy for takeaway or order whatever you see and sit at one of the tables to snack. They are known for their camel pastirma, and it was the best thing we tried - absolutely excellent.
Total price - 4.62 EUR

Bougatsopoleio Thessaloniki - Bougatsa is a famous Greek food pastry. We tried a couple versions, but the best for me was the minced meat filled bougatsa. 
Total price -  15.50 EUR

Kostas Soulvaki - Souvlaki, also known as kalamaki is perhaps the best known of all Greek street food or Greek fast food, and Kostas is considered to be one of the best places to eat it in Athens. They grill pork, stuff it into Greek pita, top it with tomatoes, onions, and tomato sauce, and wrap it into a handheld treat. Amazing.
Price - 2.20 EUR per piece

Taverna To Trigono - For dinner, Tassos wanted to take us to one of his favorite restaurants in Athens, a little outside of the city in a place called Kalyvia Thorikou. This is a countryside meat paradise, and they served us some of the best lamb chops I’ve ever had in my life. An amazing  meal to end an incredible day of Greek food in Athens.
Lamb chops
 Total price for everything - 99 EUR

MUy8Xf3_AtA,Chinese Street Food HOT POT HEAVEN + RABBIT Noodles and SPICY Dumplings in China - CHILI OIL 4 LIFE!,"Chinese Street Food in Chengdu, China is the BEST in the WORLD! 
► BRAND NEW Chili Oil 4 Life Merch here:  https://www.thefoodranger.com/Chilioil4life

In this Chinese street food tour of Chengdu, China, we're bringing you to eat at 4 classic Chengdu foods. Chinese cooking is some of the best in the world, and in Chengdu, China, the cuisine is world famously known as Sichuan cuisine or Szechuan cuisine. It is spicy and numbing and covered in delicious Chili oil. I moved here to Chengdu specifically to be able to eat spicy and delicious Chinese street foods. 

►For addresses a full Chengdu Food Tour, visit my blog post on Chengdu street food, it has a huge list of the best street foods to try in Chengdu, China. The Chengdu food guide features all of the locations within this Chinese street food video: ►https://www.thefoodranger.com/the-ultimate-chengdu-food-tour/

In this Chinese street food tour video, we're starting out with one of China's most famous foods; DUMPLINGS. In Chengdu, they are different from the rest of China. Here, they are boiled and covered in a thick and spicy chili oil that leaves you so SATISFIED! These are some of the most satisfying dumplings ever! I must admit though, the filling could have been more plump. If you are traveling to Chengdu to eat Szechuan cuisine, I would personally recommend trying the red chili oil wontons first. 

And after those amazing dumplings in Chengdu, we're eating another famous dish in Sichuan cuisine, RABBIT. Eating rabbit is very famous in Sichuan, and here in Chengdu, locals love it in a numbing and spicy Szechuan Sauce. But we wanted to try a more UNIQUE style of eating rabbit in Sichuan, on top of noodles. So we visited a local rabbit noodle joint and ate a couple unique bowls of Chinese Sichuan noodles. The first was the rabbit noodles, where the rabbit is served to you in thin slices covered in chilies, ginger, and onions. You then pour it over top of your thick and spicy chili oil broth noodle bowl. It was absolutely delicious. The next bowl of spicy noodles that we ordered was the beef noodle soup - red braised beef noodle soup. Super delicious and spicy!

After eating those 2 bowls of delicious Sichuan noodles, we are bringing you to a nice original fly restaurant of Chengdu, Mingting fandian. The fly restaurants of Chengdu are old locations that are sometimes less than cleanly but have incredible food! Nowadays most fly restaurants in Chengdu are actually really clean and you don't have to worry about getting sick from eating the street food. At mingting restaurant, we ordered a river carp,  spicy pork blood, spare ribs, fried sticky rice strips, Sichuan sausages, twice cooked pork, and pig brain tofu. It was all incredibly delicious!

And for our final meal in this Chinese street food tour of Chengdu, China, we're going for one of the most famous foods to try in Sichuan, HOT POT! We found a local 9 section hot pot that serves spicy and delicious hot pot and is always busy! For detailed addresses to these restaurants and street foods, make sure to visit my full Chinese food guide to Chengdu, China:

» THE SEAFOOD

1. DOMANNAKA: Mackerel Sashimi + Uni (Sea Urchin) + Dancing Tiger Shrimp 
ADDRESS: 101-0025 Tokyo, Chiyoda, Kanda Sakumacho 3-37-4 
OPEN: 4PM - 12AM 

🦐 Domannaka is based in Hokkaido, Tokyo, with 6 locations across the city. They are known for their unique dishes, primarily seafood served while it is still alive. They offer delicacies such as squid, mackerel and trevally. We tried their living mackerel sashimi, uni (sea urchin) and dancing tiger shrimp.

💸PRICE: Mackerel (saba) 8.59 USD/6,980 JPY for whole fish | Uni (sea urchin) USD/2,500 JPY per plate (13-20 sea urchins) | Tiger Shrimp (odorigui) USD/890 JPY per shrimp
----
2. TAKAMARU FRESH FISH STORE: Oyster + Ankimo (Monkfish Liver) + Anko Nabe (Monkfish Hotpot) + Deep Fried Monkfish 
ADDRESS: 950-1 Oshimata | Seven Park Ario KAshiwa 1F, Kashiwa 277-0922, Chiba Prefecture 
OPEN: 11AM - 9PM

🐟Takamaru Fresh Fish Store serves some of Tokyo’s finest fish delicacies. Among their delicacies is monkfish, a very rare fish that is hard to find in Tokyo, even in big fish markets. Monkfish liver (ankimo) is typically considered the tastiest part of the fish and was even listed on CNN’s 2011 list of the World’s 50 Most Delicious Foods. We were fortunate enough to get a taste of this dish, which is not a typical menu item at Takamaru Fresh Fish Store. Monkfish hotpot is a bit more common than monkfish liver, frequently eaten during the winter months in Japan.

YvlYjLPgrCE,Street Food in Ghana - GIANT CHOP-BAR LUNCH and West African Food Tour in Accra!,"This was an incredible day of street food in Ghana!
►Check out Jay: https://www.instagram.com/mukasechic/
►SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe
►T-shirts and caps available now: https://migrationology.com/store/

Jay (Mukase Chic) is an amazing woman, so positive and talented, and so much fun to hang out with and eat with! She’s a food personality, a chef, a restauranteur, a blogger - she’s incredible. Check out her Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/mukasechic/) and YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8y8uGewOe2NAuNQALV_uaw). 

Anyway, so Jay took me an ultimate street food tour in Accra, here’s all the amazing food we ate:

Red red (bean stew) and plantain - This was the first stop, a small stall that Jay has been eating at for years. They fry plantain, and then serve the plantain along with beans stewed in palm nut oil, and combine it with gari, which are cassava flakes. The result, is a filling and very satisfying combination of sweet and tangy plantains with salty oily beans. What’s key as Jay explained to me is the palm nut oil, which provides so much oil and fragrance. It was delicious, and a perfect way to begin this Ghanaian street food tour in Accra!
Total price - 4 GHC ($0.90)

Nima Market - Next we caught a taxi to Nima Market, known for its spices. We tried everything we could find, which was quite a lot of snacks here and there. The market was fantastic to walk around, full of action and energy.
Coconut toffee
Tigernuts - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Masa - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Zowey (adaakwa) - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Kulikuli - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Boiled egg - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Fried cheese - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Burkina - 3 GHC ($0.70)
Bofrot - 1 GHC ($0.20)

Peace Chop Bar (Chop Bar - Local Ghanaian restaurant) - Finally, to end this street food tour of Ghana in Accra, we stopped back at the chop bar that we had visited earlier in the morning. Seeing the cooking was sensational, it only made me hungrier for lunch. By the time we arrived back, they had already sold out of a few dishes, but there was still plenty enough to choose from. I tried the banku with goat meat, and it was fantastic.
Total price - 36 GHC ($7.90)

This was an incredible day of eating street food in Accra. Many thanks to Jay!

4rrqc3Skwr8,22 CRAZY FOOD HACKS YOU HAVE TO TRY,"DELICIOUS DISHES FOR A PARTY
We love candies and share a lot of ideas you can make using sweets. If you want to amaze your guests try to cook dishes we share! Make a cool decoration for a cake made from pears and candies. You can create a perfect flower that looks real. Make a huge lollipop with candies inside. It will be a perfect gift for kids. Decorate a cupcake with a flower made from lollipop and marshmallow. It will be a super cute flower for your candy bar. 
Another awesome idea is to make a lollipop out of sprite! Take a bowl a pour sprite, add food coloring and gelatin. Pour the mix into a mold for lollipops and freeze.  
Do you want to cook something special for your home party? The recipe of black ice-cream: take a bowl and add heavy cream, sugar and activated charcoal. Beat the mixture and add dry rice. And mix again. This perfect dessert will amaze your friends! Moreover, we have one more cool idea to surprise your friends - vegan caviar. Take a pan and pour water into it, add sriracha and agar-agar and mix these ingredients. Simmer agar-agar and sriracha for two minutes. Take a tall glass and pour vegetable oil, put into the fridge and let cool. When the vegetable oil is cold, take a syringe and squeeze out spheres of the hot mixture into the cold oil. You will see bead shapes appearing that will sink to the bottom of the glass. To separate the oil from pearls wash them with some water. Now you have fake caviar to decorate a cake or everything you like!
Camembert bread will be the best dish during your party. Cut off the top of the bread loaf, make a hole large enough to fit the camembert. Next, cut the top of camembert and place into the hole. Make incisions on bread and fill with the sauce (mix rosemary, garlic, and olive oil). Bake for 25 minutes. Yummy!

KELANTAN, MALAYSIA - If you’re looking for amazing Malaysian food, Kelantan is a state that’s unique, cultural, and has some of the best food in Malaysia.

During trips to Kuala Lumpur over the years, I had tried a number of Kelantanese dishes, but that only increased my desire to eventually visit the source, to visit Kelantan, Malaysia. Finally, this was our chance, and we went on a Malaysian food tour of Kelantan, around Kota Bharu.

Here’s all the amazing food we ate in this video:

Nasi Kerabu Panji - Without a doubt, one of the Malaysian foods you don’t want to miss when you visit Kelantan is nasi kerabu, rice salad, but it’s so much more than that. It’s a breakfast dish and we first started at Nasi Kerabu Panji, a local favorite spot. You get blue rice, topped with salad and side dishes, drizzled in budu fermented fish sauce, and topped with you choice of main mean. It was extraordinary.
Price - About 8 MYR ($1.96) per plate

Jijah's Nasi Kerabu - Since nasi kerabu is one of the top Malaysian foods of the state of Kelantan, we decided to have two nasi kerabu’s back to back, but totally different styles and even different colors of rice. Jijah's Nasi Kerabu specializes in grilled goat, and it was incredible, highly recommended when you visit Kelantan, Malaysia.
Price - 4.50 MYR ($1.10) per plate

Siti Khadijah Market - One of the top attractions in Kota Bharu is Siti Khadijah Market, a beautiful colorful market where you can buy all the ingredients from Kelantan and there’s also an amazing cooked food section. Laksam - 3.50 MYR ($0.86) per bowl - I had a bowl of laksam, a Kelantan Malaysian food version of laksa. Akok - 1 MYR ($0.24) for 2 - Later we also tried akok, a popular and local Kelantanese dessert.

D'Umi Nasi Ulam - Another Malaysian food you don’t want to miss eating in Kelantan is nasi ulam, rice with raw vegetables, and a mix of dishes, all eaten specifically with budu - fermented anchovy sauce. This restaurant was amazing, a huge mix of dishes, friendly owner, and delicious food. Of course, we couldn’t resist the tempoyak - fermented durian paste.

Kak Jah Ayam Percik Bulatan Lemal - Finally to end this Malaysian street food tour of Kelantan, we had some ayam percik, a coconut milk barbecue sauce dish that originates in Kelantan. We barely arrived in time, but luckily got the last few skewers.
Ayam percik - 16 MYR ($3.93) per big skewer

Kelantan is an amazing state in Malaysia to eat Malaysian street food and I thoroughly enjoyed my visit, the incredible food, and friendly people.

On Day 27 in Lisbon, Portugal, I made up my mind to eat as much Portuguese food and at some of the best local restaurants in Lisbon. It turned out to be a fantastic day in Lisbon with some seriously good Portuguese food!

00:36 Cafe Martinho Da Arcada at Praça do Comércio - The first place we stopped in the morning is a legendary cafe in Lisbon that is the oldest cafe in Lisbon called Cafe Martinho Da Arcada. The main reason I wanted to go there was to try their pastéis de bacalhau, classic Portuguese food codfish fritters. The coffee and ambience and of the cafe was also nice. Total price - 9.30 EUR

Restaurante Zé da Mouraria (I think it was closed for holidays) - I really wanted to eat at this restaurant during my visit to Lisbon, but unfortunately they were closed for holidays, so if you go to Lisbon and are looking for local Portuguese food, check this place out.

5:32 Restaurante Cantinho do Aziz - For our next meal, although not Portuguese food, but more Mozambican food, we headed over to Restaurante Cantinho do Aziz. The food was remarkable, one of the best meals I had in Lisbon. I first began with some beef samosas which were insanely good, and then had spicy bakra piri piri, spicy lamb ribs. Total price - 35.00 EUR

11:14 Restaurante A Merendinha do Arco - Finally, to try some authentic Portuguese food in Lisbon, we headed over to a restaurant called Restaurante A Merendinha do Arco. This small family run restaurant serves delicious Portuguese food and many of the classics. I ordered bacalhau com grão, codfish with garbanzo beans and carne de porco à alentejana, pork with clams. Along with the delicious local food, what I loved was the ambiance and feel of the restaurant. Total price - 20.15 EUR

22:10 Oceanário de Lisboa (Entrance price - 17 EUR per person) - By this point on this Portuguese food tour of Lisbon, I was feeling pretty full, so we headed over to Oceanário de Lisboa and walked around one of Europe’s biggest aquariums.

24:22 Cafe on Avenida da Liberdade (Coffee - 1.40 EUR) - One of the things I love about Lisbon is the social cafe culture and atmosphere. In the afternoon I was starting to feel pretty sleepy, so before dinner, I had a cup of coffee at an outdoor cafe along Avenida.

25:12 Solar dos Presuntos - For the last Portuguese meal in on this food tour of restaurants in Lisbon, I decided to eat at a restaurants called Solar dos Presuntos. I didn’t know it was going to be such a fancy high end restaurant, but it was our last night in Lisbon, so we decided to go for it. I started with the pata negra, a plate of incredibly good ham. Then I ordered the polvo à lagareiro, some of the most tender octopus I’ve ever had in my life. Finally we also ordered dourada grelhada - gilt-head sea bream fish. The food was expensive, but delicious. Total price - 60.85 EUR.

This was a fantastic day of Portuguese food in Lisbon, and many of the places we ate today were the best restaurants I tried in Lisbon.

DzuOaJ9f8qI,10 Foods You Should Never Eat,"We know some products are really dangerous for our health, and other products are good for us as they are healthy. It turns out it’s not so simple and some of the most promoted and popular foods can, in fact, harm you. Never eat these 10 dangerous foods for the sake of your own health and the health of your family. 
Even if you see the juice labels “not from concentrate” or “100% pure”, don't let this fool you. Juice, after being squeezed from different fruits, is kept in huge vacuum-sealed tanks where it can sit for up to a year before being packaged! And by that time, the juice has lost all its flavor, which is why manufacturers have to add artificial flavoring to make it taste fruity again.
In most cases, cereals are loaded with refined carbohydrates and sugar. Even if the label assures you that it's fat-free and whole grain, check the list of ingredients. You'll most likely see that the product is full of sugar.
Despite common belief, most yogurts don't contain probiotic bacteria since the process of pasteurization kills all these microorganisms. 
When consumed, trans-fats in ice-cream can cause high cholesterol, stroke, heart disease, and even cancer. Ice cream is also loaded with sugar, artificial flavors, and synthetic preservatives. And if it’s pink, purple, or red, it’s most likely been colored with cochineal extract or carmine, additives which can cause bad allergic reactions. 
Popcorn has some genetically modified ingredients as well as taste-boosting chemicals and additives. This leads to health problems such as heart attacks, digestive issues, allergies, skin rashes, breathing problems, and the depressing list goes on. Even more, popcorn is extremely caloric.

Low-fat yogurt 4:11
Ice cream 5:01
Eggs 6:07

SUMMARY
-Store-bought juices may contain some real fruit, but most of their content is water, sugar, and artificial flavoring.
-Protein bars and energy bars alike are usually processed products containing sugar, artificial flavors and sweeteners.
-Breakfast cereals typically contain a teeny tiny amount of whole grains, which allows producers to mark their product as healthy, but they also contain unhealthy sugar. 
-Margarine is typically made from industrial vegetable oils hydrogenated to become solid, a process that significantly increases the oils’ trans-fat content.
-Manufacturers load “low-fat” yogurts with sugar to make up for the lack of taste usually provided by the natural fats.
-Instead of pure milk or cream, manufacturers use cheaper hydrogenated fats such as palm- or coconut oil to produce ice-cream. These oils, when heated, become nothing more than trans-fats.
-One egg contains as much cholesterol as a big greasy burger.
-Microwave popcorn’s almost always lined with the same toxic substance you can find in Teflon pans.
-If candy doesn’t contain sugar, it contains artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose, and saccharine. These substances are chemically processed and may cause some serious side effects.
-Artificial sweeteners in diet soda can easily lead to weight gain as they trigger the production of insulin, which makes your body store fat.

_qhIT8sOymk,How Long Foods Stay In Your Stomach,"How long does the process of digestion last? Do you find yourself still hungry no matter how much you eat? If so, you might be eating foods that are too high on the glycemic index. It’s definitely something worth knowing if you’re struggling with excess weight. 

 The glycemic index is a system of values given to foods according to how quickly they cause an increase in blood glucose levels. To put that in layman’s terms, it basically measures how fast different foods are digested by the body. Glucose is a simple sugar that gives your body energy, and you get it from the foods you eat.

Your blood is what carries this sugar throughout your body to all your hungry cells and tissues. That’s why it’s called blood glucose. If you eat something that’s high on the index, your blood glucose will spike, giving you a fast boost of energy.

TIMESTAMPS: 
What glycemic index is 0:58
Foods that digest slowly 3:30
Foods that digest moderately 4:08
Foods that digest quickly 4:34 
Foods that don’t have a glycemic index value 5:27
What about pizza? 6:09 
Are all low-glycemic foods healthy? 6:43

Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/

SUMMARY: 
- The glycemic index is a system of values given to foods according to how quickly they cause an increase in blood glucose levels. To put that in layman’s terms, it basically measures how fast different foods are digested by the body.
- If you eat something that’s high on the index, your blood glucose will spike, giving you a fast boost of energy.
- Foods and drinks are actually split into three groups: low, medium, and high. Low items rate from 1 to 55, medium is from 56 to 69, and high items are from 70 and above.
- According to the experts at Bodytomy, some low-glycemic foods, like cooked vegetables or a salad, can remain in your stomach anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour.
- There are also foods that really don’t really have a glycemic index value since they don’t contain any carbs. But they can still take a while to be digested by your stomach. It can take you anywhere from 2 to 5 hours for your stomach to digest meats, like chicken, lamb, and pork.
- If you’re having pizza that’s just dough, cheese, and sauce, that might rate high on the glycemic index, mostly because of that dough. But believe it or not, adding toppings actually makes your slice healthier!
- You might encounter foods that will be low on the index, but if they’re processed, they most likely still contain tons of saturated fats, sugar, and empty calories.

🥒ABOUT BEFRS:
Hey, I’m Sonny! I’m from the US but currently call Vietnam home. I’ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. People either enjoyed my undeniable charm or enjoyed watching me eat things like coconut worms, and thus Best Ever Food Review Show came to be. 

I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.

JJ Virgin explains how incredibly UN-normal everyday discomforts, such as bloating, brain fog, fatigue, headaches, and muscle pain are, dissects why we have so long believed detrimental lies about our health, and explains how to turn around any of these symptoms in just DAYS. 

Through a captivating, tear-jerking, and ultimately inspiring story of her (then) 16 year old son, JJ Virgin demonstrates the importance of being the CEO of your own health, and precisely how to do so. 

She teaches about the all-too-common leaky gut syndrome and how to seal the gut up properly, once and for all, for optimal health. Food is the ultimate reset.

JJ guides you through the simple diet shifts you can start making immediately — from intermittent fasting, to eating a whole food diet, to replacing unhealthy foods with viable alternatives.

VANIJaKP1CE,Food Supply Management,"Everyone has to eat, and the agri-food sector is booming – worth around £97 billion and employing more than 3.5 million people in the UK alone. The sector is also the key to providing safe foods in an economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable manner to a growing world population on an ever decreasing cultivatable land footprint.

The effects of changing consumer demands, government edicts about dietary diseases; such as obesity and diabetes, and natural disasters mean this fast moving industry requires confident, reliable, enthusiastic employees with an excellent understanding of food production, and the skills to manage complex supply chains on a local and a global scale.

Our courses aim to equip you with the skills, knowledge, and confidence to lead this industry; either from within a large corporation, or through your own entrepreneurial business start-up. You will graduate with a food degree that is focussed towards your own interests and career aspirations; whether that is as a buyer of sustainable food ingredients, a quality or technical manager, a government adviser on food policy, or the CEO of your own food business.

Starting out, we're going for a traditional egyptian breakfast, served with Foul Fava bean dip, baba ganoush, Egyptian bread, and many more egyptian dishes. If you're wondering what do Egyptians eat, this is it, a healthy breakfast with lots of delicious baladi bread.These are all super delicious Ancient Egyptian recipes and super popular with the locals, using only the best Egyptian spices!!

After that amazing Egyptian breakfast, we're going for more Egyptian street food, but first, a stop at an amazing Alexandria cheese fondue restaurant, full of delicious beef and seafood!

And next up, we're going for the best seafood in Egypt, DEEP in the local seafood market of Alexandria, where you can buy incredibly fresh Seafood and bring it to the local grills nearby to cook in the Egyptian style. Here, we had a delicious baked fish, some squid, crab, and more. It was amazing! 

And to finish up our day of Egyptian street food after that amazing Seafood, we're going for one more Egyptian street food, the fried liver sandwiches! This is another specialty of Alexandria, and we found the best one in the city! Although I personally found it too strong, many locals love the flavour and all the Egyptian dishes that come with it!

Ting Ting and I (Trevor James, The Food Ranger), made our way to Vietnam solely to eat street food. Since we love street food around the world, we decided that Vietnam was the perfect holiday destination for street food to try, because it's supposed to be the best and we love watching new street food recipes and street food flavors as we adventure down deep, back alleyways, getting lost into new street food worlds.  So far, in our Vietnamese street food tour series, we've eaten street food in Hanoi, and then we took the sleeper train south 12 hours to Hue. Hue is the old ancient capital of Vietnam, and is packed full of different street food to try. We spent 4 days here eating and couldn't get enough of all the street food. Asian street food is the best, and in Vietnam, it doesn't get any better!

We found 11 different Vietnamese street foods in this video. If you arrive here looking to eat, you can follow along with these addresses:

1) Bun Bo hue @02:44- The specialty street food Beef and pork broth noodle soup of Hue, Vietnam - It’s absolutely rich and delicious! Found at the Dong Ba market early morning around 730am. Go to the outside of the street market and find the old ladies with big pots of good street food and you’ll discover a ton!
2) Bun Hen @ 06:10 Spicy Clam noodle soup - Also found at the Dong Ba Market in Hue, Vietnam, in the early morning! Just look around the outside of the market, the perimeter, not on the inside.
3) Banh Tam Banana Leaf @ 09:44 wrapped around marinated shrimp - Found directly beside the Bun Hen at Dong Ba market
4) Veg Soup @ 11:27 - Also found at Dong Ba Street Food Market in Hue, Vietnam
5) Bun Tith Nuong @ 14:37 Grilled pork over top of rice noodles. These was my favorite meal from Hue, and so cheap at 10,000 Vietnamese dong! Bun Thit Nuong 66 Bạch Đằng
6) Banh Mi Vietnamese Sandwich @ 17:55- This one was quite average. But still fun to eat! This one was at the intersection of Xuan 68 and Le Thanh Ton street inside Hue’s old city.
7) Douhua Silken Tofu @ 21:27 - This was a street food vendor carrying the food on wooden poles, so you have to be lucky at the right place at the right time. We were at the location below around 4:30 PM and she came along.
8) Banh Tran Truong “Vietnamese Pizza made from rice paper” @ 22:54. You can find this one inside the old city on 14 Le Thanh Ton Street in Hue, Vietnam
9) Banh Ep - Flattened rice paper dough with raw egg grilled @ 22:54 - Same location as the Vietnamese rice paper pizza
10) Nem Lui Vietnamese Pork Skewers @ 25:56 - These were found at 241 Huynh Thuc Khang - TP, Hue, Vietnam
11) Banh Xeo Vietnamese pancakes @ 25:56 - Same location as above, 241 Hyun Thuc Khang - TP. Hue, Vietnam

Talad Rot Fai (ตลาดนัดรถไฟ), also known as the Train night market in Bangkok, or Talad Rot Fai in Thai, is one of the most popular night markets in Bangkok - this branch located at Ratchada. Here’s a map link: https://goo.gl/maps/EVKBg2ws46t

By the way, this is Part 2 of this Night Market Thai street food tour. You can watch the gigantic tom yum challenge here: https://youtu.be/4eZbr5qDxio

The market is known for its unique Thai street food, some of the snacks and dishes which are invented there and you won’t find anywhere else in Bangkok.

Laeng Saeb (เล้งแซ่บ) at Diaw Maekhlong Restaurant (ร้านเตี๋ยวแม่กลอง) - Laeng saeb, a dish of pork bones and ridiculous amounts of green chilies is one of the most popular Thai street food inventions at Talad Rot Fai, and this is mainly what I came to eat. The restaurant is located at the back of the market, and they have a few different sizes you can choose from.

XXL Laeng Saeb (เล้งแซ่บ) - Price - 599 THB ($18.96) - We went straight for the XXL size, a massive platter of pork bones, soup, insane amounts of green chilies and the soup broth. Of all the Thai street food I’ve eaten, this is one of the most unbelievable and insanely giant street foods of Thailand I’ve ever seen or eaten. Although it’s way more than I ever care to eat again in one sitting, it’s actually a really good dish.

Crispy butter (เนยกรอบ) - 35 THB ($1.11)
Stir fried ice cream (ไอติมผัด) - 69 THB ($2.18)
Coconut shake (น้ำมะพร้าวปั่น) - 35 THB ($1.11)

And that completed this Thai street food night market tour of Talad Rot Fai. It’s well worth a visit, and you can of course, order smaller sizes of laeng saeb when you’re in Bangkok. Enjoy!

Q98J4e5QLt4,17 Foods You Can Eat As Much As You Want To,"How to eat and lose weight? How to stay slim without diets or gym? There are foods you can eat without risk of gaining weight. 
Let’s be honest; it’s hard to resist cravings for tasty food when you’re on a strict diet. You feel hungry all the time, and when you open the fridge, it’s almost impossible to fight the temptation to grab something unhealthy! 
However, there are foods you can eat without risk of gaining weight. Can you imagine eating popcorn at any time and in any quantity?! To figure out how that’s possible, watch our list of foods that will never make you fat.

TIMESTAMPS
Celery 0:44
Arugula 1:15
Egg whites 1:38
Salad 2:09
Cucumbers 2:41
Cauliflower 3:12
Tomatoes 4:00
Broccoli 4:27
Oranges 4:55
Kale 5:19
Sugar snap peas 5:43
Grapefruit 6:03
Melon 6:26
Strawberries 6:46
Blackberries 7:10
Popcorn 7:28
Blueberries 7:54

SUMMARY
- Celery has anti-allergic and antiseptic properties. This plant can improve your digestion and overall health. 
- There are only 10 calories in 2 cups of arugula. It helps you get slimmer without damaging your health. 
- Scientists found that eggs keep you feeling full for longer periods than foods that contain more carbs. Mix the whites with a few tomatoes and get the healthiest omelet ever! 
- Salad is packed with vitamins A and C as well as folic acid and iron. It’s practically devoid of calories (10 to 20 calories, depending on the type).
- Fresh, crunchy cucumbers have significant health benefits. The skin of a cucumber contains most of its nutritional value, particularly beta-carotene, which is good for your eyes. 
- Cauliflower is an excellent source of vitamins C and K. Also, it contains only 25 calories. 
- One tomato has about 25 calories. Tomatoes are full of lycopene, vitamins A, C, and B2, folic acid, fiber, chromium, and potassium. 
- Broccoli contains 31 calories, and it is one of the favorite foods of those who want to lose weight. 
- Oranges are one of the most delicious fruits. They are best known for their vitamin C content. By the way, the white stuff under the orange skin, the pith, is really good for you. 
- Kale, like any other edible seaweed, contains a large amount of iodine and it’s almost devoid of calories. It has about 32 calories. 
- Sugar snap peas are very low in calories: a cup of peas contains around 35 calories. 
- Grapefruits help to stabilize blood sugar levels. They’re full of vitamin C, and, due to their low caloric value, they can help you reduce those extra inches around your waist. 
-  Melon contains over half the recommended daily value of vitamins A and C and only 55 calories. Melon is also very useful for preventing flu and improving the immune system.
- Strawberries are rich in potassium and fiber and have an anti-inflammatory effect. It sounds surprising, but a couple of strawberries contain as much vitamin C as an orange. 
- Blackberries are full of antioxidants and vitamin C. Also, they have an amazing taste. 
- One cup of air-popped popcorn will never affect your body. This “movie snack” mostly consists of air, and you can enjoy eating it without fear of gaining extra weight. 
- Blueberries have more antioxidants than any other fruit. Therefore, a cup of blueberries will help you balance your diet.

Xi'an is home to some of the best street food in China - with a huge muslim population that eats only halal food, with tons of beef and lamb, noodles, and more, as well as a large Han Chinese population that has it's own distinct Chinese cuisine. Each cuisine has unique recipes and we are showing you how the cooking is done on the street!

Some of the famous Street Food in Xi'an, China is shown in this street food vlog by myself (Trevor James, The Food Ranger).

Love it or hate it, fast food is the backbone of American cuisine. But there are really only a handful of truly iconic fast food menu items. For every Big Mac, or Whopper, there are hundreds of other McNothings that somehow made it out of the test kitchen and had fast food fans scratching their heads. It's safe to say these are the biggest fast food failures of all time...

slwgXXVXM3I,"🇺🇸 Fast food, Fat profits: Obesity in America | Fault Lines","Obesity in America has reached a crisis point. Two out of every three Americans are overweight, one out of every three is obese. One in three are expected to have diabetes by 2050. 

Minorities have been even more profoundly affected. African-Americans have a 50 per cent higher prevalence of obesity and Hispanics 25 per cent higher when compared with whites. 

How did the situation get so out of hand? 

On this week's episode of Fault Lines, Josh Rushing explores the world of cheap food for Americans living at the margins. 

What opportunities do people have to eat healthy? Who is responsible for food deserts and processed food in American schools? 

Fault Lines finds food revolutions taking place and speaks with the people that are fighting back.

P2BVyHOdFUo,You Can&#39;t Reheat Some Foods Under Any Circumstances,"Is it safe to microwave your food? Let's imagine you went out to dinner last night. Chances are you brought home the leftovers and they’re sitting in your fridge right now. But before you break out the styrofoam carton, pop it in the microwave, and chow down, you should know that there are some foods that actually turn poisonous when reheated! 

No matter how tasty and healthy your freshly prepared meal is, it can lose its health benefits and even cause food poisoning if you reheat it in a microwave. Bright Side introduces to you a list of foods that you should eat as soon as they’re cooked.

SUMMARY:
- Whether they’re in a soup or stir-fry, reheating mushrooms in the microwave or on the stove is a big no-no. The change in composition can cause you to have an upset stomach, and they also lose their health benefits.
- Similarly to mushrooms, eggs are packed with protein that changes once it’s reheated. This can wreak havoc on your digestive system. In fact, eggs can become toxic when exposed to a microwave’s high temperatures.
- Even if the rice is cooked, boiling water won’t kill the bacteria. After the rice cools off to room temperature, its bacteria spores can multiply, and reheating it just keeps the bacteria alive. The longer it sat at room temperature, the more likely it is to contain harmful bacteria.
- When it’s time to reheat the breast milk, you should never heat it in a microwave because the uneven distribution of heat can create hot spots in the milk, which can seriously burn the poor baby who drinks it.
- Just like mushrooms, reheating chicken can change the food’s protein compounds and make you very sick. Unlike other meat (like beef), chicken contains a high amount of protein, which makes reheating it in the microwave a bad idea.
-  If you place cooked potatoes directly into the fridge after cooking them, it’s probably safe to reheat them. However, if they sit out at room temperature for a while after they’re prepared, they’re more likely to develop a rare bacteria known as botulism. 
- While nitrites are dangerous for adults, they’re incredibly dangerous for infants from 0 to 6 months. If they do ingest food with nitrites, they are more likely to develop “blue baby syndrome,” which can be fatal.
- Before you stick a leftover sandwich in the microwave, don’t forget to remove any toothpicks the restaurant may have stuck in there! Along with items with sharp tips, metal is a big no-no when it comes to microwave cooking.

In this street food tour vlog, we venture outside of Mexico city to Puebla, to eat the best street food in Mexico and taste the world famous Mole sauce over top of juicy chicken. It was spicy, full of chili, and so delicious.

The Best Street Food we found, was definitely the cemita sandwich from Puebla, which was made by the most amazing woman, the Sandwich Ninja of Mexico! The cemita sandwich was cut so fast with amazing skills, EXTREMELY fast! Her knife skills were incredible, chopping and cutting so fast with the avocado fruit and the chicken as well. The way her hands worked was amazing to watch, and this was just one of the street foods we had in Puebla, Mexico! The Chicken sandwich was so plump and delicious

We started our street food tour in Mexico in Mexico city, eating a ton of delicious street food in Part 1 and 2 here:

https://youtu.be/dHnqNOvDi44
https://youtu.be/W0Anp0wmXek

After this, we spent a day on a street food adventure to go to Puebla, all in search of the famous Mole poblano, but we found so much more.  The first thing we did was visit a local market and try out a bunch of food in the market, like juicy lamb tacos, covered in spicy salsa and then spicy stomach tortilla tacos as well. This is the beauty of Mexican street food, the amazing variation and extreme deliciousness of the cuisine that makes your mouth come alive. 

After those amazing Mexican tacos, we kept exploring the farmers market even more!

After this, we found the world famous Mexican Mole Poblano, famous from Puebla that was incredibly flavourful, full of chocolate, chilies, fruit, nuts, cinnamon, and more!

After exploring the street food market a little more, we drove to Puebla and found the most amazing sandwich ninja cutting up with super human skill each ingredient and fruit like avocado to put into the sandwich and slice with incredible speed and precision! She was so fast! The sandwich was prepared very fast and it was so delicious as well! She had GOD LEVEL skill, her knife skills were so fast and so fun to watch. 

After eating the sandwich with the locals and enjoying the flavour, we went on to have one final meal in Puebla, Mexico, except this one wasn't a street food. We wanted to try the stuffed chili pepper, but it wasn't in season! So we had a pumpkin seed sauce over top of pork and it was still fairly delicious.

Here are the addresses for the locations in this street food vlog:

1) Lamb Tacos with delicious spicy salsa - Inside the Cholula Farmers Market near the town square
2) Amazing Mexican salad bar featuring spicy pickled chipotle chilies and cow feet salad along with Nopales prickly pear cactus salad - Also inside the Cholula farmers market
3) Mole Poblano rich and dark chocolate sauce with chili, nuts, fruit, and cinnamon - Also found inside the cholula local farmers street food market
4) Super human fast cutting skills sandwich lady of Mexico - Found in Puebla downtown - Super Cemitas El As De Oros
5) Pretty delicious but not amazing Pueblan dinner found downtown Puebla

The Chopstick Travelers are based in Taiwan, where we frequent the best Street Food stands everywhere from Taipei to Kaohsiung. Not only do we feast on amazing street food in Taiwan, but our food focused travels take us on Street Food missions trying unique foods in places like Japan, Malaysia, Korea and Hong Kong and around the world!

I post 2 times a week mostly food, some travel. Street Food tours around the world and the most unique dishes we can find in all kinds of hole-in-the-wall restaurants. Stay updated for my latest video VIA our Facebook page and Instagram!

XVMxZMxkAgM,6 Times Gordon Ramsay Actually LIKED THE FOOD! | Kitchen Nightmares COMPILATION,"SUBSCRIBE TO THE NEW HELL’S KITCHEN CHANNEL: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt1fxPc6KaOeMxdhtUcEEEA
It’s a well known fact that Gordon Ramsay isn’t usually a fan of the cuisine on offer at the Kitchen Nightmares restaurants. However, over the many, many shows there have been a FEW examples of brilliantly cooked and seasoned food. We spent several years trawling through the episodes with a fine tooth-comb and eventually found them. Enjoy.

►Subscribe - http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe

We had one full day in Zurich, Switzerland, and I wanted to make the most of it by going on a Swiss food tour, eating as much food as possible, and walking around and seeing some of the most famou sights and attractions in the beautiful city of Zurich.

Here are all the details about everything you’ll find in this video:

Zürich, Switzerland

Café Henrici - To begin the day for Swiss breakfast, we stopped to have a cup of coffee, and also I wanted a croissant, but they were all out of the morning already, so I settled for a few small slices of bread. It was excellent.
Total price for 3 people - 24.40 CHF ($25.75)

Lindenhof Hill - This is a great place to get a view over Old Zurich, and it puts the city into perspective and helps you get your bearings, and the views are beautiful.

Swiss Chuchi - Thank you to Marcel for this recommendation. In Switzerland for a single day, I needed to eat one of the most well known of all Swiss food, cheese fondue. At Swiss Chuchi restaurant, we enjoyed both cheese fondue and raclette, both of which were excellent and the most cheese I’ve had in a  single meal in a very long time.
Total price - 126 CHF ($132.98)
That included all I ate, and 2 other plates  of food.

Grossmünster - This church is one of the most recognizable landmarks of Zurich. For a small fee, you can pay to climb to the top of the tower for an amazing view.
Price -  4 CHF ($4.22)

Lake Zurich - The city of Zurich is surrounds Lake Zurich, which is unbelievably clean and pure.

Kronenhalle Restaurant  - This is one of the most legendary and classic restaurants in all of Zurich, Switzerland. I didn’t realized it was so expensive and so high end, but we decided to go for it anyway, because I was looking forward to trying their Zürcher Geschnetzeltes, the most well known of all Zurich Swiss food dishes consisting of thin sliced potato paired with veal stew. It’s quite a stunning dish and the version at Kronenhalle Restaurant was absolutely stunning.
Total price - 126 CHF ($132.98)

Bahnhofstrasse Shopping street 

Rheinfelder Bierhalle - To finish off this ultimate Swiss food tour of Zurich in a single day we went to Rheinfelder Bierhalle, a beer hall and restaurant in Zurich. I ordered their specialty, Jumbo Jumbo Cordon Bleu. Cordon bleu is another one of the Swiss food dishes you don’t want  to miss when you’re in Zurich.

Thank you very much for watching this  Swiss food tour!

wZz11Y2CAPo,"INSANE Chinese Seafood - $1500 Seafood FEAST in Guangzhou, China - 10 KG BIGGEST Lobster + KING Crab","INSANE Chinese Seafood FEAST in Guangzhou! Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF! We found the most CRAZY Chinese Seafood in Guangzhou. This Chinese seafood restaurant is like a huge seafood Aquarium!  There is so much EXOTIC Chinese seafood here! This is like upgraded Chinese street food! GIANT Seafood HEAVEN!

If you're wanting to eat seafood in Guangzhou, you can come to Guangzhou HongXing restaurant. It has the most INSANE selection of Chinese seafood from around the world, all picked up daily from the local fish market! They have every type of seafood you can order it in a huge variety of different cooking styles. 

When you walk into hongxing seafood restaurant, you immediately feel like you're walking into a seafood heaven. This is different from our regular Chinese street food videos, this is a  Chinese seafood feast video! And today we are featuring all cantonese style cooking, one of the 8 main specialties of Chinese cuisine! This is less spicy than Sichuan food, this is much more elegant and refined and clear style, very delicious!

When you walk in, you'll see hundreds of different fish tanks full of  seafood!

You'll see at least 2 aisles full of lobster from around the world. Australian lobster, Boston lobster, and more. And you'll also find aisles full of different crabs from around the world. The biggest ones are the Alaskan king prawns. You can order these steamed or boiled and covered in a garlic sauce.  The crab legs are full of flesh! Super tasty! This is Chinese style seafood mukbang! This is way better than a regular seafood boil!

You'll also find rows of different clams, mussels, abalone, oysters, and more exotic things too. There is water beetles, snakes,  and also classic Cantonese stir fry dishes too. You can eat dim sum, fried noodles, and cantonese desserts too!

This is one of the most expensive restaurants in Guangzhou for seafood. In my opinion, if you can afford to spend a little for one crab, it is totally worth it to taste the cantonese style of cooking. 

Chinese seafood restaurant name: 东江鸿星海鲜酒店
Chinese seafood restaurant address: 广州市海珠区侨光路2号东江鸿星海鲜酒店

If you love Chinese food and Chinese cuisine, you're going to love the seafood we found in this video! So much lobster flesh, huge king crab legs, and more! I hope you enjoy this seafood feast video from Guangzhou, China!

""Let thy Food be thy Medicine and thy Medicine be thy Food."" -- Hippocrates

That's the message from the founding father of modern medicine echoed in the controversial new documentary film 'Food Matters' from first-
time Producer-Directors James Colqhuoun and Laurentine ten Bosch.

""With nutritionally-depleted foods, chemical additives and ourtendency to rely upon pharmaceutical drugs to treat what's wrong with
our malnourished bodies, it's no wonder that modern society is getting sicker. 'Food Matters' sets about uncovering the trillion dollar
worldwide ""Sickness Industry"" and giving people some scientifically verifiable solutions for curing disease naturally."" - James

And in what promises to be the most contentious idea put forward, the filmmakers have interviewed several world leaders in nutrition and natural healing who claim that not only are we harming our bodies with improper nutrition, but that the right kind of foods, supplements and detoxification can be used to treat chronic illnesses as fatal as terminally diagnosed cancer.

'Food Matters' is to be launched globally via the internet using full screen video technology.

The film's official website can be found at http://www.foodmatters.tv",Food

awtmTJW9ic8,Food for thought: How your belly controls your brain | Ruairi Robertson | TEDxFulbrightSantaMonica,"""Have you ever had a gut feeling or butterflies in your stomach? Has hunger ever changed your mood? Our bellies and brains are physically and biochemically connected in a number of ways, meaning the state of our intestines can alter the way our brains work and behave, giving a whole new meaning to 'Food for thought'. 


As a nutritionist, microbiologist and neuroscientist, Ruairi Robertson is passionate about the link between our bellies and brains. His research is examining how our intestines and the microbes within them can influence both physical and mental health, and most importantly how our diets influence this relationship. Ruairi has travelled the world researching food, and believes it is the key to global public health. Ruairi is a PhD student in University College Cork in Ireland and current Fulbright Scholar (2015/16) to Harvard University.

y-Fpj9bdht4,Knowing whether food has spoiled without even opening the container,"A color-coded smart tag could tell consumers whether a carton of milk has turned sour or a can of green beans has spoiled without opening the containers, according to researchers. The tag, which would appear on the packaging, also could be used to determine if medications and other perishable products were still active or fresh, they said. 

This report on the color-changing food deterioration tags was presented today as part of the 247th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS), the world's largest scientific society.

5RwIWGkMxrE,Food Fight: How Corporations Ruined Food (Food Industry Documentary) - Real Stories,"When we walk into a supermarket, we assume that we have the widest possible choice of healthy foods. But in fact, over the course of the 20th century, our food system was co-opted by corporate forces whose interests do not lie in providing the public with fresh, healthy, sustainably-produced food.

Fortunately for America, an alternative emerged from the counter-culture of California in the late 1960s and early 1970s, where a group of political anti-corporate protesters–led by Alice Waters–voiced their dissent by creating a food chain outside of the conventional system. The unintended result was the birth of a vital local-sustainable-organic food movement which has brought back taste and variety to our tables.

FOOD FIGHT is a fascinating look at how American agricultural policy and food culture developed in the 20th century, and how the California food movement has created a counter-revolution against big agribusiness.

Cut screen: Talking with your server

To be able to successfully order food and drinks in a restaurant you will need to first understand the common exchange between a waiter and a customer. Here are some typical questions you might hear and some  appropriate responses.

Cut screen: Ordering food
------------------------------------------------------
When ordering food:

It is common for a waiter to say: Can I take your order? → ¿Les tomo la orden?

You could answer: The enchiladas, please. → Las enchiladas por favor.


Another way a waiter might ask for your order is: What would you like to eat? → ¿Qué desean comer?

You might answer: I would like the chicken and rice, please. → Quisiera el pollo con arroz por favor.

Cut screen:  Ending your meal
------------------------------------------------------
At the end of your meal, you will need to ask for the check.

The waiter may ask: Can I offer you anything else? → ¿Les puedo ofrecer algo mas?
Or he might ask: Would you like a dessert or coffee? → ¿Desean algo de postre o café?

Cut screen:  Requesting your check
------------------------------------------------------

You could answer: No thank you. The check please. → No gracias. La cuenta por favor.

Or you could say: No thank you. Could you please bring us the check? → No gracias. ¿Nos puede traer la cuenta por favor?

TEDxTeen opening music by BlackDoe

Rob is an adventurer, activist, and dude making a difference. His purpose is to inspire health, happiness, and freedom on Earth and he’s dedicated his life to this mission. He has cycled across the United States, twice, on a bamboo bicycle, went 1,000 days without showering, and has dove into thousands of dumpsters across America, all to inspire positive social and environmental change. When not out adventuring he lives off the grid in a fifty-square-foot tiny home in San Diego. His extreme adventures and activism campaigns may appear unattainable at first glance but within them are an abundance of simple lessons and tips that can be adapted into any life to live with more happiness, health, and freedom.

r4DOQ6Xhqss,Food Matters Official Trailer,"http://www.foodmatters.tv

""Let thy Food be thy Medicine and thy Medicine be thy Food."" -- Hippocrates

That's the message from the founding father of modern medicine echoed in the controversial new documentary film 'Food Matters' from first-
time Producer-Directors James Colqhuoun and Laurentine ten Bosch.

""With nutritionally-depleted foods, chemical additives and ourtendency to rely upon pharmaceutical drugs to treat what's wrong with
our malnourished bodies, it's no wonder that modern society is getting sicker. 'Food Matters' sets about uncovering the trillion dollar
worldwide ""Sickness Industry"" and giving people some scientifically verifiable solutions for curing disease naturally."" - James

And in what promises to be the most contentious idea put forward, the filmmakers have interviewed several world leaders in nutrition and natural healing who claim that not only are we harming our bodies with improper nutrition, but that the right kind of foods, supplements and detoxification can be used to treat chronic illnesses as fatal as terminally diagnosed cancer.

'Food Matters' is to be launched globally via the internet using full screen video technology.

Tracing the making of a bowl of wonton noodle soup, a 101 East investigation exposes the toxic stew this iconic dish has become.

From tainted additives in noodles, to growth hormones in pork, to industrial filler posing as meat, presenter Steve Chao finds that anything is possible for producers looking to cut corners and make a fast buck.

We had one full day in Zurich, Switzerland, and I wanted to make the most of it by going on a Swiss food tour, eating as much food as possible, and walking around and seeing some of the most famou sights and attractions in the beautiful city of Zurich.

Here are all the details about everything you’ll find in this video:

Zürich, Switzerland

Café Henrici - To begin the day for Swiss breakfast, we stopped to have a cup of coffee, and also I wanted a croissant, but they were all out of the morning already, so I settled for a few small slices of bread. It was excellent.
Total price for 3 people - 24.40 CHF ($25.75)

Lindenhof Hill - This is a great place to get a view over Old Zurich, and it puts the city into perspective and helps you get your bearings, and the views are beautiful.

Swiss Chuchi - Thank you to Marcel for this recommendation. In Switzerland for a single day, I needed to eat one of the most well known of all Swiss food, cheese fondue. At Swiss Chuchi restaurant, we enjoyed both cheese fondue and raclette, both of which were excellent and the most cheese I’ve had in a  single meal in a very long time.
Total price - 126 CHF ($132.98)
That included all I ate, and 2 other plates  of food.

Grossmünster - This church is one of the most recognizable landmarks of Zurich. For a small fee, you can pay to climb to the top of the tower for an amazing view.
Price -  4 CHF ($4.22)

Lake Zurich - The city of Zurich is surrounds Lake Zurich, which is unbelievably clean and pure.

Kronenhalle Restaurant  - This is one of the most legendary and classic restaurants in all of Zurich, Switzerland. I didn’t realized it was so expensive and so high end, but we decided to go for it anyway, because I was looking forward to trying their Zürcher Geschnetzeltes, the most well known of all Zurich Swiss food dishes consisting of thin sliced potato paired with veal stew. It’s quite a stunning dish and the version at Kronenhalle Restaurant was absolutely stunning.
Total price - 126 CHF ($132.98)

Bahnhofstrasse Shopping street 

Rheinfelder Bierhalle - To finish off this ultimate Swiss food tour of Zurich in a single day we went to Rheinfelder Bierhalle, a beer hall and restaurant in Zurich. I ordered their specialty, Jumbo Jumbo Cordon Bleu. Cordon bleu is another one of the Swiss food dishes you don’t want  to miss when you’re in Zurich.

Thank you very much for watching this  Swiss food tour!

awtmTJW9ic8,Food for thought: How your belly controls your brain | Ruairi Robertson | TEDxFulbrightSantaMonica,"""Have you ever had a gut feeling or butterflies in your stomach? Has hunger ever changed your mood? Our bellies and brains are physically and biochemically connected in a number of ways, meaning the state of our intestines can alter the way our brains work and behave, giving a whole new meaning to 'Food for thought'. 


As a nutritionist, microbiologist and neuroscientist, Ruairi Robertson is passionate about the link between our bellies and brains. His research is examining how our intestines and the microbes within them can influence both physical and mental health, and most importantly how our diets influence this relationship. Ruairi has travelled the world researching food, and believes it is the key to global public health. Ruairi is a PhD student in University College Cork in Ireland and current Fulbright Scholar (2015/16) to Harvard University.

Just to be clear, this video is not sponsored or endorsed by any of the restaurants depicted, or any other company. This was in fact a hidden camera exposé, and no foods were tampered with in any way.  They were all served to me exactly as they appear in the video. 

And in case you're wondering what I did with all of this food, my cameraman ate some of it and I gave the rest to the workers who were painting my next door neighbor's house.

Find out how food computing could be used to create, save, and share climates for growing nutritious and delicious crops no matter the location or season.

Camille Richman is a Research Specialist in the MIT Media Lab’s Open Agriculture Initiative, which develops open source controlled environment agriculture technology platforms that promote food transparency, networked experimentation, hands-on education, and local food production.

Camille is a mechanical engineer in Open Agriculture’s anti-disciplinary team of architects, computer scientists, electrical engineers, and farmers.

Her work is currently focused on the development of the Food Computer, a desktop controlled environment farm that can be used to create and share climate recipes, modifications, and upgrades.

Camille hopes that by creating a network of Food Computer users sharing their hardware, software, and climate data knowledge, the science behind modern agriculture technologies will be accessible to the masses.

go_QOzc79Uc,Teach every child about food | Jamie Oliver,"http://www.ted.com Sharing powerful stories from his anti-obesity project in Huntington, W. Va., TED Prize winner Jamie Oliver makes the case for an all-out assault on our ignorance of food.

Jamie Oliver is transforming the way we feed ourselves, and our children. Jamie Oliver has been drawn to the kitchen since he was a child working in his father's pub-restaurant. He showed not only a precocious culinary talent but also a passion for creating (and talking about) fresh, honest, delicious food. In the past decade, the shaggy-haired ""Naked Chef"" of late-'90s BBC2 has built a worldwide media conglomerate of TV shows, books, cookware and magazines, all based on a formula of simple, unpretentious food that invites everyone to get busy in the kitchen. And as much as his cooking is generous, so is his business model -- his Fifteen Foundation, for instance, trains young chefs from challenged backgrounds to run four of his restaurants.

Now, Oliver is using his fame and charm to bring attention to the changes that Brits and Americans need to make in their lifestyles and diet. Campaigns such as Jamie's School Dinner, Ministry of Food and Food Revolution USA combine Olivers culinary tools, cookbooks and television, with serious activism and community organizing -- to create change on both the individual and governmental level.

RwZY1jaw2EM,Food Matters (PART 1) - First 8 Minutes,"Dear Friend,

What you're about to learn could likely save your life, or that of someone you love. This was certainly the case with my Father. 

About 6 years ago my Father was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Depression and Anxiety. The best the medical profession could offer was a cocktail of medications to treat the symptoms and little in the way of hope for treating the underlying causes. Not surprisingly his health continued to decline.

At the same time we were studying nutrition and sending my father many books we had read but these didn't seem to help convince him. So for the next 12 months (with 3 years of research up our sleeves) we set about creating the independent documentary film 'Food Matters'.

'Food Matters' features interviews with leading health experts who reveal the best natural healing choices you can make for you and your family's health. In the film you'll discover what works, what doesn't and what's killing you.

Needless to say after my father saw the film he quit his pharmaceutical meds, changed his diet, lost 20% of his body weight and is now running 3 times a week which is a big change from being bed ridden for 5 years!

Thank you for your support in helping this lifesaving information reach more people, it would not be possible without you.

James Colquhoun & Laurentine ten Bosch

Producer / Directors 'Food Matters'

PS: You don't have to take our word for it, here is what others are saying about the film.  

""Everything I have been harping on for the last 40 years, these two have brilliantly encapsulated in one beautifully produced, eminently watchable video."" - Harvey Diamond, Author of America's best selling health book 'Fit For Life'

""This film lays out the inconvenient truth the food industry doesn't want you to hear -- that nearly all degenerative disease is actually caused by the processed, nutrient-depleted food being consumed in first-world nations around the world. 'Food Matters' dares to reveal how we can stop this cycle of destruction and restore true health to ourselves and our planet."" - Mike Adams founder of Natural News.com


 ""Anyone who is serious about their health needs to see this stunning film.""
- Christiane Northrup, MD, author of the Women's Wisdom series


 ""James and Laurentine provide a radiant beacon of hope with steps you can do today to take control of your health and begin healing. This is such important information - and much aligned with my personal health philosophies. It's time to get it out to everyone who will listen. I encourage you to order a copy of Food Matters today and watch it with your friends and family.""

But you’re older now and you don’t always have to restrict your life to what you were ordered to as a child. So take that newly found freedom and mess about with your food once in awhile--food can be incredibly versatile visually if you know how to use it, just like whoever made this probably delicious rendition of Han Solo’s best friend out of noodles, rice and leafy greens.

7. Dead Man Burgers
  Sure this burger verges on the violent side, but the cartoonish faces the food makes kinda makes up for it. Kinda. What’s better is that making these don’t call for overly complicated ingredients or methods. It’s all the stuff you would regularly put in a burger, just with a little more effort and energy. But really, how hard is it to make mustard and ketchup eyes? What’s even better, other than the fact this particular photo is that of a vegan burger, is that depending if you’re a fan of lots of ketchup on your burgers, you can make it as messy as you want. If you wanted to do the most, you could also carve teeth into the hamburger buns and up the ketchup slathering. The only out of the ordinary thing you would need is a gingerbread cookie cut out.









6. Dog Eat Dog
  This is the much more scaredy-cat friendly alternative to the man eating burger. Mayumi, who runs the blog “taste of japan”  made these hot dog eating puppies by first shaping the buns and baking them herself, complete with cute black bean noses and eyes.























5. Panda Curry
  A plate of curry’s never looked more adorable. These rice balls wrapped in seaweed swimming towards a lake of food is too cute to eat--though it looks pretty good to eat, too. It seems that rice balls are really versatile foods and are always incorporated into cute food art ideas.




















4. Sugarcube Skulls
  There’s nothing more ordinary than your everyday cup of joe. So if you want to spice things up in the morning and you’re inclined towards the more gothic and creepy, you can use these cool skull and bones shaped sugar pieces instead of regular cubes, packets or spoonfuls of the stuff. Artist Snow Violent came up with these bones shaped sugar cubes under their Sugar Skulls series. And honestly, edible art is the best kind of art. Or edible anything, really.

























3. Finger Sandwiches
  Literally, these are finger sandwiches. Online, you’ll find the recipe for these snacks up the name of “Creepy, Dead Man’s Fingers Sandwiches. They seem strangely real, but they’re apparently really easy to make. All you need is bread (any kind of your choosing) butter, a spread like cream cheese or peanut butter, almonds for the fingernails and strawberry jam for the bloody mess. Actually, it sounds like it would taste quite fine, even if it looks creepy.",Food

Rob is an adventurer, activist, and dude making a difference. His purpose is to inspire health, happiness, and freedom on Earth and he’s dedicated his life to this mission. He has cycled across the United States, twice, on a bamboo bicycle, went 1,000 days without showering, and has dove into thousands of dumpsters across America, all to inspire positive social and environmental change. When not out adventuring he lives off the grid in a fifty-square-foot tiny home in San Diego. His extreme adventures and activism campaigns may appear unattainable at first glance but within them are an abundance of simple lessons and tips that can be adapted into any life to live with more happiness, health, and freedom.

guxledYcXcE,Processed Food Documentary - Processed Food vs. Nutritional Needs,"Processed Food Documentary: Processed Food vs. Nutritional Needs.

The human body runs on food.  Once, food shortage was the major concern.  After the second world war, technological advances in food production led to a new era, that was characterized by an overabundance of inexpensive food, and relatively little physical activity.  In the decades that followed, other sociocultural shifts continued to contribute to the changing way we ate.  Women who had previously controlled most of the average family's food preparation now entered the workforce in significant numbers.  And the processed food industry began to capitalize on our need for fast, convenient food.  

This meant that fewer meals were being cooked at home.  And since convenience foods were generally higher in calories than home-cooked meals, the average person's caloric intake increased dramatically.

Maya Adam, MD, is waging a battle cry against one of America’s most critical – and challenging – public health crises of our generation: childhood obesity. A lecturer at Stanford School of Medicine and in Stanford University’s human biology program, she is leading the cause through education.

Actually, there are foods you can eat without limitations even if you’re crazy about keeping your figure. Sounds too good to be true! These foods are rich in fiber while being low calorie, satiating you without the risk of gaining weight. Lucky you – today, we’ve compiled a list of such foods! 

And forget the myth that you’ll gain weight if you eat after 6pm. It’s completely wrong! In fact, if you want to stay slim, it’s best to have dinner 3-4 hours before bed. So if you go to bed at 11 p.m., you can calmly eat at 7 p.m. It won’t hurt your figure at all!

SUMMARY:
- If you fry popcorn without butter and sugar (with a little salt, for instance), you can eat it without fear. This way, a portion (about a cup) only contains 31 kcal.
- Celery stems are 95% water. They help you lose excess weight and detoxify your body thanks to their diuretic effect. A medium-sized stalk of celery contains only 6 calories!
- A portion of eggplant grilled or baked without oil makes for 24 kcal, so you can enjoy this savory veggie without any limitations.
- A large amount of fruit is not recommended if you want to lose weight, yet citrus fruits are an exception here. They’re rich in substances like fiber, flavonoids, and vitamin C.
- Melon and watermelon are 95% water. With 60-70 kcal per slice, you can eat them day in and day out. These fruits help excrete excess liquid from your body and satiate you well.
- Algae, like laminaria, are the best source of iodine. They help your thyroid function normally, keeping your hormones at normal levels and preventing you from gaining weight.
- A portion of zucchini is about 42 kcal. It normalizes your salt-water ratio, improves your intestinal function, and can also be used to lower the energy output of main courses.
- A cucumber is 95% water; therefore, this vegetable can quench your thirst easily. And the remaining 5% is a source of vitamins and minerals.
- Beetroot is a source of nutrients, such as manganese. They help burn fat, drive your muscles, and regulate your blood sugar. An average portion is just 40 kcal!
- You can eat eggs at any time of the day, even at night, without fear of gaining weight. Of course, boiled eggs are better than fried ones. One boiled egg contains about 80 kcal!
- The bromelain contained within pineapples actively splits fats and helps metabolize proteins. A slice of pineapple is about 30 kcal.
- One apple is only 50 kcal. It makes you feel satiated and regulates your digestion. Plums are rich in vitamin C and potassium, which maintain your heart and vessels.
- Salad is a great source of folic acid, and you can eat it by the ton: one leaf of lettuce is 3 kcal!
- Currants and cranberries are rich in vitamin C, and the former is also a diuretic, helping get rid of excess water.
- A portion of diced cabbage is just 7 kcal. You shouldn’t, of course, only eat cabbage and cauliflower, as their nutrients rival with iodine, but you can easily include these foods a couple of times a week.

Our travel and food in sikkim was fun, had great time in Gangtok...If you have any experience of Gangtok in terms of sightseeing or food, do share that in comments below…

Travelling cost:  Refer to EP 1 description section on how below cost is calculated.

Min cost to reach Gangtok: Rs 500.
Hotel: Rs 1500 per day.
Food Rs 500 one meal
Total cost of Day 0: Rs 2500

Day1 : Cab for local sightseeing  for 8 hours Rs 2500.
You may want to take share cab for point to point travelling but then you can't travel to all tourist destinations. 

Example from MG marg you can take a share cab for trolley point by paying Rs 20.. but you can't go to Hanuman Tok on share cab as on that route no share cab.,

OLA and uber taxi service not available.

you : can take cab for travelling from one point to another , but that's expensive they charge anything from Rs 200 to Rs 400...

Day 1 : 
cab : 2500
food 1000
hotel: 1500
Total cost of Day 1: Rs 5000.
Above cost will apply for Day 0 and Day 1 will be 2500 plus 5000 equals to 7500.

I paid much higher cost because i had exclusive taxi all the time, i stayed in 3 category hotel which was expensive.

TeLiBBxIbaw,Foods You are NOT Allowed to Eat In the USA !,"Whether it’s rotten cheese consumed by maggots, or mysterious brownies that make you really sleepy, here are foods you’re not allowed to eat in the US

Subscribe to American Eye http://goo.gl/GBphkv

6. Mirabelle Plum
Don’t get caught acting suspicious around the police if you got a few of these illegal plums stashed on you! These plums you see here are grown only in the Lorraine region of France and people from the US won’t get to taste them unless they travel to western europe. You’re probably thinking, “what’s the big deal”? They’re just plums for crying out loud not an endangered species or anything. It’s somewhat of a mystery why exactly they’re banned but the answer seems to come down to money. In order to protect the financial income of the eastern province in France, most countries have agreed not to sell them. It’s a little bit similar to how we have to have the differences between Champagne and Sparkling water. Whatever the reason exactly might be, you aren’t allowed to eat them, cuz we said so! 

5. Unpasteurized Milk
Most of the milk we drink and the cheese we eat must go through a process known as pasteurization first before we consume it. The process was introduced by Louis Pasteur in the 1860’s and This kills the bacteria and other microbes which would be harmful for consumption . not only that but this allows for it to be stored on the shelf longer. Although some states allow the sale for raw milk 17 states have banned it. Those who are in favor of non pasteurization claim that the milk loses many of its nutrients once it goes through the process.  But those who claim pasteurized milk is the way to go state that too many diseases are spread from just raw milk. In any case, it is probably best not to drink raw milk unless it’s from the mom to the offspring

4. Lazy Cakes
This cakes are banned in arkansas and strangely enough, they might actually make you feel lazy. The brownies are laced with melatonin and are known to cause severe drowsiness. Melatonin is often used as an over the counter sleep supplement and typically isn’t found in our food. Rumors went on full effect when people started saying that they put some type of synthetic cannabis substance in there but in any case they will make people sleepy. Maybe people who sell them don’t realize they’re not your average brownie, and you have to kind of read the fine print to find out. 


3. Pig’s Blood Cake
Who on Earth would eat something that sounds this horrifying? If you guessed the Taiwanese, good job! Pig’s blood cake has been banned in the US due to sanitary reasons and whatever other reason they find is fine by me. No need to guess what the secret ingredient is with this one. It’s basically like a street food delicacy that’s made with soy broth, sticky rice and oh yeah, pigs blood! The rice is then dipped in blood and deep fried. Other ingredients might be used to coat the deep fried pig blood on a stick but once you eat it, you have to live with yourself! Supporters of the treat claim there is no sanitary issues with the preparation process but it’s still banned here!


2. Conch Queen
This beautiful shellfish becomes actually pretty tasty once you open it up and eat it. The conch queen is a banned food in the US to import mostly because overfishing threatens its existence. It’s actually more like a giant sea snail which has a very sturdy shell. The caribbean is the main exporter of conch meat to the us and demand for it quite high and the US is responsible for 80 percent of the consumption of this endangered creature.  


Purple Mangosteen 
One forbidden fruit that you probably shouldn’t eat or at least be aware of is the purple mangosteen. This is a highly sought after fruit which which a delicacy in thailand must be destroyed completely if it’s found in the US! The problem isn’t that it’s a rare fruit or anything but the goal isr to keep the asian fruit fly out, which is responsible for complete destruction of some crops. The tropical species has already wreaked havoc on the state of Florida and we don’t want this thing in our country! It’s been notorious for attacking over 400 different species of fruits and vegetables.",Food

Where does bread get its fluffiness? Swiss cheese its holes? And what makes vinegar so sour? These foods may taste completely different, but all of these phenomena come from microorganisms chowing down on sugar and belching up some culinary byproducts. Erez Garty shows how your kitchen functions as a sort of biotechnology lab, manned by microorganisms that culture your cuisine.

Is it worth the waiting for,
If we live till eighty-four
All we ever get is gruel,
Every day we say our prayers
Will they change the bill of fair?
Still we get the same old gruel
There's not a crust not a crumb
Can we find can we beg can we borrow or cadge,
But there's nothing to stop us from getting a thrill,
When we all close our eyes and imagine,

Food glorious food
Hot sausage and mustard
While we're in the mood cold jelly and custard
Pease pudding and saveloys
What next is the question?
Rich gentlemen have it boys
IN-DI-GESTION

Food glorious food
What is there more handsome
Gulped swallowed or chewed
Still worth a kings ransom
What is it we dream about?
What brings on a sigh?
Piled peaches and cream about six feet high

Food glorious food
Were anxious to try it
3 banquets a day

Just picture a great big steak fried, roasted or chewed

Chinese Street Food Islam - Muslim Chinese Street Food - Street Food China
I made my way to Lanzhou, in search of the best Chinese street food and halal Chinese muslim food. I found a ton of street food and specialty halal snacks. Lanzhou is in the northwest of China, close to the far west Xinjiang province, and is home of the Hui people, and the food is fantastic! There was a lot of Chinese street food and Islam muslim Chinese cuisine. Just like you, I love street food around the world, and I travel for food. I came here to eat!

Street food in China is something I'm always looking to find more of! So I flew to Lanzhou, China and have been trying Chinese Muslim Hui Halal Street food non stop. Best Street Food in China I've tasted! The Chinese food is so good in Lanzhou! I've eaten street food in Bejing, street food in Shanghai, street food in Chengdu, and street food in Hong Kong, all of which has been amazing, but I have to say that the chinese street food in Lanzhou has been some of the best! 

When you think of China, you probably don't think of Islam and Halal food, but that's exactly what you'll find in the Northwest. I made my way for a  food trip to the dusty and bustling classic Silk Road city of Lanzhou specifically to try the unique halal food of the Hui people. This is the side of China not many people see, and I came here to have an authentic travel experience through food.  I found a lot of food reminiscent of countries further west, with insane amounts of lamb and beef leaving me absolutely speechless. 

Here are the addresses for the places I ate Chinese Hui Muslim Halal Street Food of in Lanzhou, China. You can show a taxi driver these addresses and he will bring you there:
 
Amazing Hand Pulled Noodles 兰州七里河北滨河中路2168号 -吾穆勒蓬灰牛肉面

Lyrics:

Intro (spoken)

Yo man...
Yo I know you see me here dude!!
I've been waiting here like 10 minutes, man!
No, no no... this is MY parking space man.
What you need to do is put your little hybrid in reverse, 
And go out the way you came in.
WHAT?!?!
Yo its about to get REAL in the Whole Foods parking lot man...

Chorus  (with feeling)

It's getting' REAL in the Whole Foods Parking Lot
I got my STEEL and you know it gets sparked a lot
Im on my grind homie... It's on my mind homie!
These fools with clip boards are lookin' at me like they know me!

It's getting' REAL in the Whole Foods Parking Lot
You know the DEAL with the little shopping carts they got...
Check out what I say, it happens every day...
It's how we LIVE on the west side of LA!!

Verse 1

... Im ridin' slow in my Prius...
all leather, tinted windows... you cant see us!!
Everybody's trying to park, you can feel the tension
I'm in electric mode... can't even hear the engine (Shhhhhhh)

Just then I saw a spot open up, 
My timings perfect... Im creepin' up...
But then this other dude tried to steal it going the wrong way
Yo man, I've had a LONG DAY!

Chorus 
(same as before)

Verse 2

Now I'm on this inside, looking at my list
Organic chicken, Kale Salad and a Lemon Twist.
Some girl in yoga pants is lookin at me funny
I'm just trying to find a decent Pinot Noir for under twenty!

Then I take it to the cheese counter, Humboldt Fog?
We just ran out sir!  Really Dog?
Take it easy man, I try to calm myself...
I've been on edge ever since they took Kombucha off the shelf...

Chorus

(same as before)

Verse 3

This Busters on his iPhone talking to his friends, 
Picking up some cayenne pepper for his master cleanse.
You're the most annoying dude I've ever SEEN brah... 
Could you PLEASE move?  You're RIGHT in front of the Quinoa.

Damn, I'm about to check out.
Pay my 80 bucks for 6 things and get the heck out.
The express lane is moving hella slow...
Man, these fools don't know... that shit is getting REAL....

Chorus
(same as before)

iBznPAx6ZJY,Dutch Foods To Try,"Dutch Foods To Try - There are a lot of delicious foods to try in The Netherlands so we put together our own little DIY Dutch food tour to try as many as possible. 

One special Dutch food to try in The Netherlands is poffertjes - also known as the world’s cutest little pancakes. They are teeny tiny, fluffy, and melt in your mouth. They taste heavenly and you shouldn't miss trying them because they are seriously delicious and unique. I loved seeing how they’re made fresh to order in a poffertjespan. I found watching how they are flipped over super quickly was a bit hypnotic. You can get them with all sorts of toppings. My personal choice was chocolate sauce and powdered sugar. You generally order these by the dozen and you could eat as many and hardly notice because they’re so light and airy, unlike American pancakes. These Dutch cuties were one of my favourite things we tried in The Netherlands. 

A lot of Dutch snack foods are deep fried. One of the most popular is called a frikandel. It’s basically a minced-meat, skinless sausage that’s deep fried. Very similar to a hot dog. Personally the best part of this snack for me was the sauce. The ‘frinkandel speciaal’ is eaten with mayonnaise, curry ketchup, and chopped onion. It has a nice sweet taste. 

Another popular Dutch snack food is called a kaassouffle (cheese souffle). It’s melted cheese, usually Gouda, inside a doughy wrap that’s then deep fried. Cheese is important in The Netherlands and eaten widely. I have yet to see a Dutch refrigerator without a huge block of Gouda in it. Along with the poffertjes, the kaassouffle was my favourite Dutch snack food we tried. It’s pretty much deep fried cheese so what’s not to love?

Krokets are a Dutch food you’ll see everywhere and they look similar at first glance to a kaassouffle. A kroket is usually cylindrical and filled with meat. As you might have guessed, it’s also deep fried. It’s long been an economical way to use leftovers of meat stew and roasts which are then mixed with gravy, rolled into logs, breaded, and fried. It became really popular during World War II as a cheap food. It’s crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

Stroopwaffel is quintessentially Dutch. It means syrup waffle and is made by baking a thin waffle and, while it’s still warm, breaking it in two. Then a warm caramel-like filling is added before the two halves are pushed back together, using the syrup as glue. They’re very popular to eat on their own or with other sweets. 

We also tried Surinamese and Javanese food, which is widely available in The Netherlands. Suriname and Indonesia were colonized by the Dutch and I was excited to try this type of food as I had never seen it before. My sample dish came with chicken, potato, hard boiled egg, noodles with peanut sauce, rice, vegetables and bread. For dessert, we had a deep fried banana with peanut sauce. I also tried a Surinamese soda called Cherry Bouquet but it was way too sweet for me - even though I have a massive sweet tooth. 

I included fries in this video even though they’re Belgian, not Dutch. But they’re really popular in The Netherlands and I didn’t think I could make a video about foods to try there without including fries. Make sure you try them with lots of different sauces. My favourite is truffle mayonnaise followed closely by curry mayonnaise. 

I hope that you enjoyed seeing these different Dutch foods to try in The Netherlands. I’d love to know which food you’d most like to try if you had the opportunity. Or, if you’ve already tried them, which is your favourite?

►T-shirts and caps available now: https://migrationology.com/store/

Bushmeat is a term that is used to often describe wild game meat in Africa. And while there some types of bushmeat that are not good or unsafe to eat - grasscutter - also known as a greater cane rat, is safe and one of the most popular types of bushmeat to eat in West Africa. It’s a delicacy!

So while we were driving on our way to Elmina, Ghana, along the side of the highway, we stopped at some hunters, and bought a grasscutter. 

Later in the day, we met up with our host family, and we drove over to the Elmina fishing market. The market was amazing, bright and colorful, and energetic, with some unique fish and seafood available from the Atlantic. We bought some fish to go along with our grasscutter, and then we continued back to the house to start cooking.

First for lunch, Mama made us a dish called Eto, a mash up of yam and palm nut oil, topped with eggs. It was a little on the dry side for me, but it was an honor to have a chance to try that special Ghanaian dish.

For dinner we prepared the fish and grasscutter. The fish was made into Ghanaian groundnut or peanut soup, which is one of the best dishes I at in Ghana. The grasscutter was made into a bushmeat grasscutter light soup which included chilies, garlic, onions, ginger, and tomato.

Finally, for the main start of the meal Mama made omo tuo, Ghana style rice balls.

How does grasscutter taste? The greater cane rats run around the fields and eat grass, so unsurprisingly some parts kind of taste like grass. But they are a white meat, and have a similar look to chicken, but the meat is even sweeter. It was also surprisingly fall apart tender. I thought it was amazing!

Across West African food, grasscutter is a very popular meat, and a delicacy eaten on special occasions.

Now, to answer some FAQs...
- The food in this film was consumed either by myself or my dog after shooting. None of the cast went to waste.
- The software used was photoshop and after effects.
- The film took me 3 months to do.
- Although it seems like stop motion, most of it was stop motion created within After effects, using keyframe animation. I am basically moving the food around within the the program, frame by frame, which is the same as traditional stop motion, only it's digital.",Food

Mz2OSnUjILQ,japanese street food - OKONOMIYAKI お好み焼き,"Okonomiyaki お好み焼き o-konomi-yaki is a Japanese savory pancake containing a variety of ingredients. The name is derived from the word okonomi, meaning ""how you like"" or ""what you like"", and yaki meaning ""grill"". Okonomiyaki is mainly associated with the Kansai or Hiroshima areas of Japan, but is widely available throughout the country. Toppings and batters tend to vary according to region. In Tokyo, there is a semi-liquid okonomiyaki called 'monjayaki.'お好み焼き
Kansai- or Osaka-style okonomiyaki is the predominant version of the dish, found throughout most of Japan. The batter is made of flour, grated nagaimo (a type of yam), water or dashi, eggs and shredded cabbage, and usually contains other ingredients such as green onion, meat (generally thin pork belly, often mistaken for bacon), octopus, squid, shrimp, vegetables, konjac, mochi or cheese. Okonomiyaki is sometimes compared to an omelette or a pancake and may be referred to as a ""Japanese pizza"" or ""Osaka soul food""お好み焼き
Some okonomiyaki restaurants are grill-it-yourself establishments, where the server produces a bowl of raw ingredients that the customer mixes and grills at tables fitted with teppan, or special hotplates. They may also have a diner-style counter where the cook prepares the dish in front of the customers.
In Osaka (the largest city in the Kansai region), where this dish is said to have originated, okonomiyaki is prepared much like a pancake. The batter and other ingredients are pan-fried on both sides on either a teppan or a pan using metal spatulas that are later used to slice the dish when it has finished cooking. Cooked okonomiyaki is topped with ingredients that include otafuku/okonomiyaki sauce (similar to Worcestershire sauce but thicker and sweeter), aonori (seaweed flakes), katsuobushi (bonito flakes), Japanese mayonnaise, and pickled ginger (beni shoga).お好み焼き",Food

LYRICS:
Iʼll start with a taco, soft like a cloud 
I want mine crunchy, I like to eat loud. 
Iʼll choose a chalupa, Iʼll grab a gordita, 
and two taco salads for our senoritas. 
And a Burrito Supreme, with extra sour cream 
Itʼs a cylindrically shaped seasoned beef dream. 
A taquito. An enchirito. Some cinnamon twists. 
A chicken border bowl.  Are you gettinʼ all this? 

And you know that nothing beats a 
hmmm, mmmm...Mexican Pizza... 
Weʼll take two of those, but please hold the diced tomatoes. 
And I admit, Iʼve always felt, 
like Iʼm in love with the meximelt. 
Make mine with a little extra love, and think of me... 
as the cheese drops from your Taco Bell glove. 
 and thatʼs it.  

No! Iʼm not done...Iʼll also take a... 

Double-decker taco cause Iʼm feeling wild 
And make my sauce Fire. Uh, heʼll take mild. 
and weʼll take two Mt. Dew Baja blasts 
for a chance at 25 dollars cash 
Iʼm told thereʼs a winner for every 5 minutes 
Iʼm stealing your online code if you win it. 
Why would you do that? You owe me 25 bones 
I owe you 5.  Plus interest--it was a loan. 
And I think weʼll be satisﬁed, if we get some mexican rice on the side. 
And thatʼs it.",Food

gvHMiduRS-g,10 Foods You Should and Shouldn&#39;t Wash Before Cooking,"Since childhood, we’ve been taught to always wash everything we’re about to eat to make it safe for our health. However, very few people know that sometimes this habit does more harm than good. Washing certain foods can spread dangerous bacteria that make their way into your body and wreak havoc on your well-being. 
You don’t need to wash store-bought eggs since they’ve already been washed during commercial processing. Plus, manufacturers often put special substances on eggs to protect them from bacterial contamination.
When you wash chicken or meat, the water helps the bacteria spread to your hands and the kitchen sink. Washing mushrooms isn’t a good idea because the more water mushrooms absorb, the weaker their flavor is. You should also never soak, remove the stalk, or peel them.
You absolutely have to wash fruits and vegetables with both edible and inedible skin. Don't soak fruits and vegetables in water, either. This won't clean them but only spread the bacteria. Use running water, it's a safer bet. Just dry the food with a paper towel or a napkin after the “cold shower”.
Food will definitely get contaminated if you don't wash the can really well before you open it. You should also always wash fresh nuts before eating them, even if they’re peeled.

Music: Seven – Twenty 
https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music

TIMESTAMPS
Never wash these foods:
Eggs 0:29
Chicken 1:10
Meat 2:08
Pasta 3:11
Mushrooms 3:55
Always wash these foods:
Fruits and vegetables with edible skin 4:30
Fruits and vegetables with inedible skin 5:12
Cans 5:58
Nuts 6:34
Dried fruit 7:21

SUMMARY
-Don't wash store-bought eggs. You will remove the protective layer so if the shell gets cracked, chances are the egg will become infected.
-When you wash chicken, the water helps the bacteria spread to your hands and the kitchen sink.
-Just like chicken, you shouldn't wash raw meat, like beef, pork, veal, or lamb, because it’s also covered in bacteria that the water just spreads all around.
-Washing pasta is pretty much criminal in the culinary world because the water removes the starch that helps the noodles absorb sauce more effectively.
-Washing mushrooms isn’t a good idea because the more water mushrooms absorb, the weaker their flavor is.
-Rinse fruits and vegetables with edible skin under regular cold running water to remove 99% of the dangerous bacteria. Dry the food with a paper towel or a napkin after the “cold shower”.
-Even if you aren't planning on eating the rind of a lemon or orange, you still need to wash these fruits and also scrub the outside with a clean brush.
-Wash your tin cans with soap before you ever open them to prevent their contents from getting contaminated. 
-Washing nuts helps get rid of the phytic acid they contain. Plus, you never know for sure where they’ve been stored, how they were transported, and how many people touched them at the grocery store.
-Even if you bought dried fruit in a nice pretty package, you have to wash it first or soak it for a few hours.

The epidemics of obesity and diabetes are continuing to spread across the western world. Now we know why. Modern science has revealed our mistake.

The unnecessary fear of natural food has inadvertently caused us to eat more of the new food that can make us hungrier, make us eat more, make us fat.

Ever more people are realizing the mistake and seeing the solution. The food revolution is here. Please help spread the word once you know.

delZeD7K95k,Amazing food processing machine #3,"Hello everyone,
Today I will introduce you the next part of compilation 's food processing machine; such as: burger machine, ice cream machine, noodle machine,... There are the food and fruit we use everyday. Let 's watched how it 's processing.
Thank you for watching and Hope you enjoy with this.

Food processing is the transformation of raw ingredients, by physical or chemical means into food, or of food into other forms. Food processing combines raw food ingredients to produce marketable food products that can be easily prepared and served by the consumer. Food processing typically involves activities such as mincing and macerating, liquefaction, emulsification, and cooking (such as boiling, broiling, frying, or grilling); pickling, pasteurization, and many other kinds of preservation; and canning or other packaging. (Primary-processing such as dicing or slicing, freezing or drying when leading to secondary products are also included.)
A machine is a tool containing one or more parts that uses energy to perform an intended action. Machines are usually powered by chemical, thermal, or electrical means, and are often motorized. Historically, a power tool also required moving parts to classify as a machine. However, the advent of electronics has led to the development of power tools without moving parts that are considered machines

Millions of Americans currently struggle with hunger, and those numbers are on the rise. And while the price of fresh food has risen in recent decades, junk food remains plentiful and often cheap. For many of the hungry in America, the extra pounds that result from a poor diet are a side effect of hunger itself.

JUpidCc7wwY,Dead Kennedys: Soup Is Good Food,"We're sorry
But you're no longer needed
Or wanted
Or even cared about here
Machines can do a better job than you
This is what you get for asking questions

The unions agree
'Sacrifices must be made'
Computers never go on strike
To save the working man you've got to put him out to pasture

Looks like we'll have to let you go
Doesn't it feel fulfilling to know
That you-the human being-are now obsolete
And there's nothing in hell we'll let you do about it

[Chorus]
Soup is good food-(We don't need you any more)
You made a good meal-(We don't need you any more)
Now how do you feel-(We don't need you any more)
To be shit out our ass
And thrown in the cold like a piece of trash
We're sorry
You'll just have to leave
Unemployment runs out after just six weeks
How does it feel to be a budget cut?
You're snipped
You no longer exist

Your number's been purged from our central computer
So we can rig the facts
And sweep you under the rug
See our chart? Unemployment's going down
If that ruins your life that's your problem

Soup is Good Food, Etc.
We're sorry
We hate to interrupt
But it's against the law to jump off this bridge
You'll just have to kill yourself somewhere else
A tourist might see you
And we wouldn't want that

I'm just doing my job, you know
So say uncle
And we'll take you to the mental health zoo
Force feed you mind-melting chemicals
Til even the outside world looks great

In hi-tech science research labs
It costs too much to bury all the dead
The mutilated disease-injected
Surplus rats who can't be used anymore

So they're dumped (with no minister present)
In a spiraling corkscrew dispose-all unit
Ground into sludge and flushed away
Aw geez:.

Soup is good food
You made a good meal, etc:.
We know how much you'd like to die
We joke about it on our coffee breaks
But we're paid to force you to have a nice day
In the wonderful world we made just for you
""Poor Rats"", we human rodents chuckle
At least we get a dignified cremation
At yet
At 6:00 tomorrow morning
It's time to get up and go to work",Food

fZaqyfGuRr8,Sui Dhaaga: Made in India,"""Sui Dhaaga - Made in India"" is a heart-warming story of pride and self-reliance, which finds its roots in the heart of India and reflects the passion that runs through the veins of every single Indian. Taking the message of ""Made in India"" forward, the film modestly tries to bring back our traditional art forms and handicrafts in focus. Through Mauji (Varun Dhawan) & his wife Mamta (Anushka Sharma), the film talks about the need of social entrepreneurship as a tool for social and economic development of our artisans, living their life in the margins due to the changing times. Set in a small town in India, the film encapsulates the journey of an honest man from a humble background, who pursues his passion, overcoming all odds and soon finds himself on the cover of an international magazine with the world taking note and appreciating his talent. A clean family entertainer, the film emphasizes virtues like honesty, self-respect and community living.",Food
